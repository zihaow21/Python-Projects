            "body": "Dorie Greenspan's Cheesy-Bacony Quick Bread. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post) Greetings from Paris, where I'm pondering time, friendship, early-evening drinks and cheese bread. I'm in Paris a whole less than I'm in New York, yet I see my French friends a whole lot more. It's not that I prefer the French set. It's not even that I'm more gadabout here. Nope, I think it's because there are so many more opportunities to see friends in Paris, and they're all built into the rhythm of the day. In addition to breakfast, lunch and dinner, there are three other let's-get-together moments: Pre-work. The caf\u00e9s open before the crack of dawn, and sharing the first coffee of the day with a friend at your regular place is simple. (My husband and our friend, Bernard, meet five days a week at the Petit Suisse, where the waiters start making their espressos as they see them coming down the street.) At about 4 p.m. for go\u00fbter. While the word \"go\u00fbter\" is pretty much reserved these days for kids' afterschool snacks, the practice of stopping for something sweet continues among adults, giving all of us grown-ups a kind of bonus: the chance to see friends and to be indulgent. \"L'heure de l'ap\u00e9ro.\" The cocktail hour. Ap\u00e9ro really is just about an hour, but it needn't be cocktails that are served. Most often, the beverage is wine and the accompaniment is something nibbly: a tasty tide-you-over tidbit that will hush tummy rumbles yet leave room for a meal (which usually doesn't begin until 8 or later). The go-along might be something as plain as salted nuts, a few slices of dried sausage or cherry tomatoes (a big French favorite that I don't fully understand), or it might be a kind of cheese bread, a member of the \"cake sal\u00e9,\" or savory cake, family. (Yes, the French say \"cake\"; they use the word for almost anything baked in a loaf pan.) In France, such a bread makes for a nice before-dinner nibble. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post) I had my first cheese bread about a decade ago in Reims, the champagne capital of France, and I've been a faithful fan ever since. Essentially a quick bread, meaning that it gets its rise from baking powder, not yeast, the cheese bread is hardly a light little nothing. Rather, it's a substantial loaf that, when cut into slender fingers or snackable cubes, is just the right thing with a glass of white wine or, yes, champagne. Although the bread comes in as many varieties as there are cheeses, the one I make most often uses those not-at-all French classics, cheddar and Gouda, as well as bacon, walnuts, very untraditional apple and, for a surprise, cumin. I like to pack as much texture into the bread as I can, so I make the batter with grated cheddar and small chunks of Gouda; the cheddar melts into the bread completely, and the Gouda half-melts and half keeps its form. As for the cumin, it's a new addition chez me, one I adopted after having Gouda that was made with cumin seed. Takeaway tips \u25cfThe bread is the kind of thing a resourceful French cook would make with whatever cheese was left over at the end of the week. This means that although you should respect the proportions of the recipe, you can go your own way with the cheese. Pick one you can grate for the batter, then choose whatever you'd like for the chunky add-in. \u25cf\u200aI use ground cumin in the bread; it's an ingredient I always have on hand. But you can use cumin seeds, if you prefer. You could even go halfsies, using some ground cumin in the batter and some seeds along with the mix-ins. \u25cf\u200aWhen you're combining the wet and dry ingredients, take it easy. There's no need to get a perfect blend, because you'll soon be stirring in the cheese cubes and their mates. With quick breads, undermixing beats overmixing. \u25cf\u200aCajole the batter into the corners of the pan - it's a thick, unusually spongy batter, and you'll need to nudge it into place - and don't give much thought to smoothing the top. When you slide the bread into the oven, pop some white wine into the refrigerator. By the time the bread bakes and cools, it'll be \"l'heure de l'ap\u00e9ro\" and you'll be on top of it. Cheers!

You'll need an 8\u00bd -by-4\u00bd -by-2\u00bd -inch loaf pan. MAKE AHEAD: Wrapped well, the bread can be kept overnight at room temperature; it can be frozen for up to 2 months. From cookbook author Dorie Greenspan. Ingredients Unsalted butter, for greasing the pan 1 3/4 cups flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin (may substitute cumin seed or a combination of ground and seeds) 3 large eggs, at room temperature 1 teaspoon fine sea salt 1/3 cup whole milk, at room temperature 1/3 cup grapeseed, canola or olive oil 4 ounces grated extra-sharp cheddar cheese (1 cup) 3 ounces bite-size cubes Gouda cheese (3/4 cup) 1/3 cup toasted walnuts, coarsely chopped (See NOTE) 4 to 6 slices bacon, crisp-cooked, cooled and chopped 1 medium apple, peeled, cored and cut into bite-size pieces Steps Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Generously grease the loaf pan with butter. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and cumin (to taste) in a mixing bowl. Use a whisk to beat the eggs and salt in a separate bowl for 1 minute. Pour in the milk and oil, whisking until blended. Pour this mixture over the dry ingredients and whisk gently, just to moisten the flour - there's no need to be thorough. Switch to a spatula and stir in the cheeses, toasted walnuts, bacon and apple to form a thick, spongy batter. Scrape it into the pan, taking care to push it into the corners. Do the best you can to even the top, and don't fret when it's lumpy. Bake (middle rack) for 45 to 55 minutes or until the bread is golden brown and a tester inserted deep into the center comes out dry. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let it rest for 5 minutes. If needed, run a table knife around the edges of the bread before turning it out (right side up) and leaving it to come to room temperature. To serve as a nibble with drinks, cut into thick slices, then into fingers or bite-size pieces. NOTE: Toast the nuts in a dry medium skillet over medium-low heat for several minutes or just until fragrant and lightly browned, shaking the pan as needed to prevent scorching.

            "body": "Clint Robinson's chances of making the Nationals' Opening Day roster are slimmer than a few days ago. (Brad Penner/USA Today Sports) WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - A text message rocked Clint Robinson's world Monday afternoon. It was his agent informing him that the Washington Nationals had agreed to sign Adam Lind, another left-handed hitting first baseman, to a major league contract to take Robinson's job the day before pitchers and catchers reported. Robinson immediately wondered if the Nationals would designate him for assignment, because he doesn't have any minor league options remaining. Then he thought about his family. Then he thought about the money he had paid up front to rent an apartment through Airbnb for 45 days in pricey West Palm Beach. \"It's unexpected,\" Robinson said Thursday, his 32nd birthday. \"But that's part of the business.\" [Boswell: Nats are lost in the supermarket, unsure how much they have to spend] Robinson has not been designated for assignment. He's still a member of the Nationals and will be at the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches when position players officially report for spring training Friday. His status in the organization is undoubtedly different than it was just a few days ago after a disappointing 2016 season, but he is also that same guy who was drafted in the 25th round, didn't make his major league debut until he was 27, despite winning a Texas League Triple Crown, and didn't make an Opening Day roster until he was 30. \"You can't afford to be angry about it,\" Robinson said. \"It's part of the game. The front office has a job to do as well as the players. Their job is to try to do what they think is best for this team to go forward winning ballgames. My way of thinking has always just been, 'As long as there's jersey in my locker, put it on and let whatever happens happen.' Whether it be competing for a job on this team or getting an audition for other teams if it weren't to work out in my favor to be here.\" Robinson finally found a major league home with the Nationals after emerging to claim a spot on Washington's bench two springs ago. He capitalized on his first opportunity with regular playing time when Ryan Zimmerman was injured in 2015, batting .272 with a .782 on-base-plus-slugging percentage and 10 home runs in 252 plate appearances. He played first base and both corner outfield positions, appearing in 126 games and starting 109. [Expect a flurry of 'Ks' among Nationals' new promos this season] Last season was different. He played in just 104 games and made 39 starts, including only two in the outfield. His production at the plate also dwindled, to a .235 batting average and .637 OPS. On the other hand, Lind, whose signing became official Wednesday night, tallied his sixth career 20 home run campaign last season with the Seattle Mariners and posted a .717 OPS. \"I think last year was still a learning experience as far as being a bench player 100 percent of the time,\" said Robinson, who added he is ready and willing to play more outfield this season. \"And I think even though the success that I wanted and the organization wanted wasn't there, I think I'm going to take it as a learning experience. And now I feel more confident going forward as a bench player. There's a lot of ups and downs in this game and it's how you deal with the failure that's going to define you. So I think last year, even though it wasn't exactly the year I wanted to have, and it could've hurt me as far as going in this year having a spot, I think in my career going forward it could help me.\" Robinson said he spoke to Manager Dusty Baker on Wednesday. The two exchanged the typical spring training pleasantries but did not dodge the uncomfortable conversation about Robinson's future. Baker provided some advice. \"He told me the same thing that I was telling myself: Just go out and play,\" Robinson said. \"You can play in this league, it's just a matter of fighting for it. They say that for a lot of guys. A lot of guys can play in the big leagues, but there's only so many spots. Don't worry about who's got this spot, who's signed this. All this kind of stuff. Just go play and let it work itself out.\"",

                "If I had to guess, Clint needs to play more regularly, and that's why he was so much better in 2015 than last season. Lind seems to be better as a pinch hitter, but it may be that he needs the regular reps as well. Other than that, Lind's record as a hitter seems quite a bit stronger.",
                "\"Last season was different. He played in just 104 games and made 39 starts,\" - How much better might Lind be if he only gets this number of opportunities? Robinson hits when he gets to the plate regularly. Will Lind hit if he can't get in the lineup because Zim stays healthy? \nYeah, I know, but one can hope, right?",
                "This guy's paid his dues. Rizzo needs to do right by him. If he's not in their plans , they need to let him hook up with another team.",
                "Luckily for him, that's pretty much how it will work. Clint doesn't have any minor league options. I'm not sure if he can outright refuse a minor league assignment, but if not other teams will have the opportunity to grab him.",
                "Best as I can tell, he has not accrued enough service time (just over 2 years) to refuse an outright assignment.",
                "LA already outrighted him so he can refuse it. I don't recall this changing in the new CBA.",
                "Last year I would have been happy for this to happen because of what happened to Tyler Moore, primarily because Robinson was left-handed.  This year I feel bad for him.",
                "If 2015-ish Robinson shows up in ST, I think the Nats will very seriously consider keeping him on the bench.  He may be redundant, but he's a good bench piece when he's on.  Also, the chance of a ST injury to Zim still exists, and if that happens Lind will probably start and Robinson remains on the Nats' bench.    The odds are definitely against him coming north with the team, but stranger things have happened.",
                "I cannot believe my fingers are tapping the following out.........I agree with you 100%.",
                "Clint has a great attitude.\n\nI wish him all the best, whether in Syracuse on for another team.\n\nWe appreciate being a good teammate and always putting in 100%.",
                "I immediately thought about whether he would accept going to Syracuse for a while early on.  I always have felt that a player really needs to play quite a bit to get his timing down.  When Zimmerman gets his typical injury Robinson can come up to be a sometimes starter and pinch hitter and have his timing pretty well set.  On the other hand, there are other teams who might want him.  A lot depends on whether he looks good in ST.",
                "I don't think he'd make it through waivers, ... but maybe.",
                "Hope things work out for him, but I suspect he's done as a Nat. Happens to maybe a hundred or so players every year.",
                "A hundred?  Sounds real high to me.  I would think there's probably 1 or MAYBE 2 per team."

            "body": "Christine Baranski as Diane Lockhart in \"The Good Fight.\" (Jeff Neira/CBS) This piece discusses the basic setup for CBS's \"The Good Fight.\" \"The Good Wife\" may have wrapped up an uneven final season last spring, at a moment when it looked like the show's fantasy of a woman's recovery after her politician husband's adultery might be leading into the election of America's first female president, specifically a woman who had endured a parallel humiliation. We all know what happened in November, of course. How pop culture responds not merely to Donald Trump's victory, but also to Hillary Clinton's defeat, may be a minor issue compared with the stakes of this young, tumultuous presidency. But I can't help but be grateful that Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), one of the standout lawyers from \"The Good Wife,\" is returning to television on Feb. 19 in a spinoff called \"The Good Fight\" that will air on CBS's new streaming service, CBS All Access. Just as \"The Good Wife\" captured some of the particular emotional responses to Clinton's first loss in a presidential campaign, \"The Good Wife\" could be exactly the show to scratch certain itches that have emerged in the wake of her second loss. One of the things that made Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies), the titular \"Good Wife,\" a fascinating character was that she offered an opportunity for viewers to glimpse something that was typically unavailable to them: the decision-making processes and private passions of a woman whose very public husband had betrayed her and then asked her to stand by his side. \"The Good Wife\" allowed us to see the white knuckles, slapped faces and shed tears concealed behind steely public expressions. It showed us the Florricks' sleeping arrangements when Peter (Chris Noth) was released from prison on home monitoring, and Peter's efforts to negotiate his way back into Alicia's bed. The series imagined Alicia's conversations with her children about the wrenching violations in her marriage. And most deliciously, \"The Good Wife\" suggested that a betrayed wife's desires don't end with her husband's idiocy: Alicia's romance with Will Gardner (Josh Charles) was knee-weakening, swoon-worthy, one of the best, most complicated love affairs to air anywhere on television in the last decade. These were all things a woman such as Clinton couldn't be in public. During her two campaigns for the presidency, she and her husband presented a united front, their daughter, Chelsea, stayed in tight orbit around her parents, and while Clinton appeared to have found a more consistent style during the 2016 campaign, it was one that emphasized sleekness and power rather than sex appeal. And the frisson between the fiction of Alicia's private life and the reality of Clinton's very public one came in part from the juxtaposition of their second acts. \"The Good Wife\" premiered in 2009, shortly after Clinton had responded to her loss to Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries by taking a job as his first secretary of state. In the context of Alicia's story, Diane represented an alternate model of adult, professional womanhood, a goad to Alicia rather than a clear answer to Alicia's dilemmas about whether to stay with her husband, how to make friendships outside the context of suburban motherhood and how to handle the balance of power in her relationships. When the series began, Diane was unmarried and childless. She was a name partner at her firm rather than a woman returning to the workforce after a decade and a half away. While Alicia concealed her political beliefs - and at times, her political ambivalence - behind one of pop culture's best poker faces, Diane was a liberal activist with a platform and record that allowed her to take cases that would advance the causes she believed in. \"The Good Fight,\" like \"The Good Wife,\" involves a fractured marriage, Diane's to Kurt McVeigh (Gary Cole), a ballistics expert pledged to the tea party whose courtship with Diane during \"The Good Wife\" involved trading barbs and Sarah Palin biographies. (Diane herself is, of course, a Clinton fan.) But there's a darker resonance at work here, too: The premise for \"The Good Fight\" involved Diane retiring at what seemed like the height of her career, only for her to be shattered by a Ponzi scheme that wipes out her savings. That scenario raises a similar question to conjecture about what Clinton will do about her bruising loss to Trump in the 2016 presidential election: What does a woman do when she's been stripped of not just her marriage, but also the reward for her hard work and accomplishments? In the weeks after the election, Clinton sightings abounded: she was walking in the woods near her home in New York, or shopping for books or buying ingredients for Thanksgiving dinner. She attended Trump's inauguration, an event that prompted a fresh round of speculation about her mind-set. And she's announced some early, anodyne plans: a book based on quotations that have inspired her and plans to return to Wellesley, her alma mater, to deliver a commencement address decades after she served as her class's speaker at her own graduation. Just as part of the pleasure of \"The Good Wife\" was watching Alicia Florrick do what Hillary Clinton couldn't when she still hoped to compete for her country's highest office, part of the promise of \"The Good Fight\" could be watching Diane Lockhart be all the things that Clinton can't in the wake of the election: publicly defiant, righteously rageful and very much back in the game.",

            "body": "Add David Duchovny to the long list of actors who have used their fame to become gigging musicians. The New York native best known for his role as the brooding Fox Mulder on \"The X-Files\" or bacchanalian Hank Moody on \"Californication,\" Duchovny released his first album, \"Hell or Highwater,\" last year. A literature major with degrees from Princeton and Yale, Duchovny, 56, found it easy to match poetry he had been writing to the music he was just learning on guitar. He also writes prose, having published two successful novels and readying a third. Following a short inaugural European tour, Duchovny and his band will make their Birchmere debut Feb. 26. We spoke to the actor-musician recently while he was en route to his first U.S. tour date in San Diego. Q: What brought you to music this late in your career? A: I've always loved music, and it was just something where I had a lot of down time. I always told myself I was always going to learn guitar at some point, and I finally did. I'm in my trailer so long. As an actor, you sit on your hands for three hours and then you act for 10 minutes. That's just the nature of it. So while I wait, why don't I learn guitar, because that will make me happy to be able to play music and listen to it. It kind of organically grew from just knowing a guitar well enough to throw some chords together, and then putting some melodies over those chords. I guess the lyrics came most easily because I've always written words. So before I knew it, I was putting songs together. Q: Are people skeptical of this new direction? A: Sure. We only have so much room in our brains for other people. So people think of me a certain way. If they don't think of me as \"X-Files,\" they think of me as \"Californication,\" or they maybe think of me from some other movie. But that's probably as much as they care to think about me. So if I come and tell them I'm a singer as well, yeah, maybe they don't want to think about that. But certainly, there are some other examples of actors who make music. I don't judge it categorically. I think music, of all the arts, is really the most unprejudiced. Your ears are not looking at anything; you're just listening. And you either like the music or you don't. I'm fine with that. Not everybody's going to like it. Not everybody's going to hate it. I'm making music for myself and for those who might get something out of it as well. Q: What music got you inspired enough to pick up a guitar? A: I'm a pretty much a child of the late '60s. I had an older brother who kind of defined my music taste, because he had enough money to buy albums, and he had a record player. So he was the DJ of the house. So I would say my tastes were really formed by '60s music. You know, the British Invasion, Beatles, Stones, Kinks, Who, Zeppelin ... And then when I got $4 in my pocket to buy an album, I went a little softer than my brother. I was kind of into Elton John, then I went to Steely Dan. I was into Yes, like, prog-rock for a while. I also liked funk. After that, Bowie, Lou Reed, so I was kind of all over the place ... I do like the singer-songwriters as well. Q: Do you see yourself in that tradition? A: I guess if I have to see myself in that tradition. I'm a guy who's writing songs on a guitar. I guess that's a singer-songwriter. Q: Do you think music is something you will continue to do? It's not a phase? A: I don't think it's a phase. It's definitely like a new door that I opened later in my creative life. It just seems fertile for me. It's been an interesting way to express myself and connect in ways that the other things that I've done don't. Q: Who do you see in your audiences? Fans of your acting? A: I imagine they are. I'm not vain enough to think they're coming out because they know the music. It's hard to make an impression in the music business. Especially because I don't think my stuff is exactly what's radio friendly right now. It's like, \"Come for the actor, stay for the music.\" So if I get you in there, you're going to hear the music, and you're going to like it or not. And maybe you'll come back. In Europe, honestly, one of the most amazing things was people singing along to my songs in a language that wasn't their first. That was special. Q: Do you have new acting projects coming up? A: I'm looking at new shows to do right now. I've got a few things that are taking shape and are pretty interesting to me. I've got a movie script of [my novel] \"Bucky F------ Dent\" that I want to make as a director. The nice thing about music is that I can do it wherever I am. Q: You returned to \"The X-Files\" last year. How was that experience, and is there talk of doing more of those? A: We're talking about doing more of those soon. The experience was strange at first to go back to something that I'd started, at the time, over 20 years ago, and I hadn't done for seven or eight years. But since I had done that character for so long, it was really simple to find it again. But it was also an interesting challenge, because it was playing a guy who's older, and maybe character doesn't change, but we change a little bit - our energy changes as we age. Our maturity changes. So it was interesting to try to bring that to the guy. [Hank Stuever reviews the new 'X-Files'] Q: I understand you're returning to play another character after 25 years, transgender Special Agent Denise Bryson on \"Twin Peaks,\" when the show returns this spring. A: Yes. That character was kind of ahead of her time way back when. And I believe that society has caught up to Denise Bryson finally. I feel good about that.

            "body": "Injuries have in part limited the effectiveness of Shawn Lauvao. (Brad Penner/USA TODAY Sports) Washington has three pieces set in stone along its offensive line: Trent Williams at left tackle, Morgan Moses at right tackle and Brandon Scherff at right guard. The team has hopes Spencer Long can continue to show promise as he develops at center, making left guard the only real spot in question. Shawn Lauvao has been somewhat inconsistent since he signed with Washington, in larger part due to various injuries that have limited him. [If the Redskins part ways with Kirk Cousins, here are three options at quarterback] All told, Lauvao is a potential cut candidate, with Washington able to save $4 million towards the salary cap if it parts ways with him, per overthecap.com. If the team opted to move on from Lauvao, they would need a replacement. Here are three savvy options, one big name, one good value and one under-the-radar candidate in free agency. Big name: Kevin Zeitler, age 26 Zeitler has been the Bengals' starting right guard since they drafted him in the first round back in 2012. He isn't necessarily a flashy player, not many offensive lineman are, but finds a way to win blocks more often than not. Here against the Broncos, the Bengals call for a counter run to their left. That requires Zeitler to pull from his right guard position and kick out the edge defender to that side. Zeitler works across to his block without any trouble, but as he engages, he loses leverage. He allowes the edge defender to get underneath him and explode up into him. Zeitler, however, has plenty of natural strength and withstands the pressure from the defenders, maintaining the block as the running back approaches. Zeitler prevents the edge defender from disengaging, keeping the running lane clear for the back, who bursts through the line of scrimmage on his way to a 50-yard gain. Zeitler isn't a particularly outstanding athlete at guard, though he's athletic enough. He suits power-based schemes more than zone, but that's not to say he's limited to one scheme. He has experience in Jay Gruden's offense as Gruden was the offensive coordinator in Cincinnati during Zeitler's rookie season. [How the Redskins can replace Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson] In pass protection, Zeitler is similarly effective. He doesn't always use textbook technique, but he gets the job done. On this play, Zeitler is matched up against Eagles defensive tackle Fletcher Cox. Zeitler attempts to surprise Cox, flashing his hands quickly with an early punch to his chest. Most offensive lineman normally sink back off the line of scrimmage in pass protection, but here, Zeitler catches Cox off-guard with an aggressive block. The punch stonewalls Cox initially, who counters by working to the outside. Zeitler manages to mirror Cox's movements, forcing him wider. The technique isn't necessarily ideal, but it results in a clean pocket for his quarterback. Zeitler already has a connection to Washington having played under Gruden previously. The Bengals offense still has a lot of similar concepts to Gruden's offense, meaning he should be able to transition smoothly. However, he is one of the top guards available in free agency this year, meaning he is likely to be in high demand, thus driving up his price tag. Washington may well decide to go for a cheaper option. Good value: Larry Warford, age 25 At 6-foot-3, 332 pounds, Warford is a big-bodied offensive lineman. He very much plays to the mauler stereotype that is typically associated with guards of his size. He packs a punch, using plenty of power when run blocking. Here, the Lions run a zone play to their right. Typically, a player of Warford's size isn't a great fit in the zone scheme, which normally deploys smaller, more agile lineman. But Warford can still find a way to be effective. Warford's assignment primarily is to work up to the linebacker. However, on his way there, he helps the center, who has the tough task of blocking Giants defensive tackle Damon Harrison, one of the top run defenders in the league. Warford simply leans into Harrison on his way to the linebacker, but his size forces Harrison into the wrong gap. That gives the center the opportunity to cut off Harrison inside. Warford works up to the linebacker, but fails to keep his pad level low. The linebacker gets under him, but Warford has enough strength to withstand the punch from the linebacker and not give up any ground. Warford maintains the block as the running back bursts past and then shows the type of mentality coaches love. He finishes the block with conviction, throwing the linebacker to the ground. In pass protection, Warford is effective in a phone-booth, meaning he works well in small spaces. If a stunt is run that forces him to work in space, he can be slightly exposed. But the strength he displays when run blocking translates to pass protection too. On this play, the Eagles line up Fletcher Cox as a three-technique defensive tackle, on the outside shoulder of Warford. Warford wins leverage early, getting his hands inside and on the chest of Cox. From that position, he has the ability to control the block. Cox attempts to regain leverage, fighting with his hands to disengage with Warford. But Warford's length allows him to reach Cox with one hand and keep control of the block. Warford realizes he has the center working over to help him with Cox, so he looks outside to see if he can help the right tackle. The edge defender gets the better of the tackle, so Warford attempts to slide and cut off the edge rusher. He manages to get an arm on him, delaying the rush while still engaged with Cox. This gives quarterback Matthew Stafford all the time he needs to deliver his throw. At 25, Warford is still young and should provide good value over the life of a contract. If Washington wants to commit to running the ball more, as Scot McCloughan teams typically do, then adding a guard like Warford would certainly help in that regard. However, if Gruden continues to lean more towards the pass, then Warford's limitations in pass protection may force Washington to look elsewhere. Under the radar: Ronald Leary, age 27 Leary is the forgotten man on the Cowboys offensive line. La'el Collins replaced him as starter, but Leary was forced into action after Collins was lost for the season back in Week 3. Leary is a very capable starter and filled in well for Collins as the Cowboys' offensive line led the team to a 13-3 record and the top seed in the NFC. While he's listed at 6-foot-3, 320 pounds, he displayed a good initial burst off the line of scrimmage. On this outside zone run to the right, Leary has to work up to the second level to take on the Mike linebacker. Leary gets a great jump off the snap, taking his first step before most of his teammates even get out of their stance. On his way to the second level, Leary helps out left tackle Tyron Smith. He lands a punch with his left arm on the shoulder of Giants defensive tackle Johnathan Hankins. That stops Hankins from penetrating the gap and gives Smith time to reach the block. Leary gets past Hankins so quickly that Hankins desperately grabs on, holding on to the Leary's left arm. He refuses to let go, holding him back to give the Mike 'backer a chance to evade the block. Leary still nearly manages to get to the linebacker to cut him off, but the defensive holding from Hankins is clear and the penalty gets called. In pass protection, Leary shows good awareness of different blitzes and understands which player he needs to pick up. Here, the Eagles send the slot corner and a linebacker on a blitz from the left side of the offensive line, while dropping the defensive end on the far side into coverage. Leary spots the blitz coming and prepares himself for the defensive end stunting inside. Leary picks him up and rides him inside towards center Travis Frederick, leaving Smith and the running back to pick up the linebacker and slot corner. Leary has good control of the block, but as he leads him inside, Frederick works across to land a big hit, blowing up the block and eliminating the chance of the defender generating pressure. Like Zeitler, Leary also has a connection with Washington. He played under offensive line coach Bill Callahan in Dallas. The Cowboys use a lot of similar run concepts and protection schemes. He's also spent most of his career at left guard, meaning he's a solid plug-and-play option straight away, without having to transition from the right side. Leary provides the right mix of scheme fit, age and value which could make him a good option for Washington in free agency.",

            "body": "Marcin Gortat, second from right, encouraged the Wizards' front office to pick up Markieff Morris, second from left. (By Brett Davis / USA TODAY Sports) Wizards center Marcin Gortat has been an outspoken advocate on behalf of Markieff Morris from the second the forward arrived in Washington last winter. The two big men played together in Phoenix, and when Washington traded for the out-of-favor Suns castoff, some fans were unsure about the move. But Gortat immediately said Morris would make the Wizards better, on and off the court. He's also pointed out to multiple reporters that, after an Arizona columnist criticized Morris last season, he stood on the table for his former teammate, both on the Internet and inside Verizon Center. Morris, he thought, was being unfairly maligned, and his reputation could suffer. \"That's why I stood up on the Internet and I said 'This is wrong what you did, he's not like that, I'm telling you,' \" Gortat recently told me. The columnist \"said 'We've got to get him out of here.' And I said 'We'll pick him up then. We'll take him.' So I was the one calling to Tommy Sheppard and Ernie [Grunfeld]. I said 'If there's an opportunity, you've got to pick him up.\" I told them, he's gonna be great for us, trust me. That's how it was. I said 'it's gonna be great opportunity for us to have him.' And look at how he's played this year.\" [Wizards dismantle Pacers to stay hot entering all-star break] @paulcoro @PaolaBoivin I Dont know who u r lady to say this like that???MM is talented player and just because he ain't playing great now - Marcin Gortat\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 (@MGortat) December 26, 2015 @paulcoro @PaolaBoivin doesn't give u right to say all those things ! He is too young to be put in this category u talking about. - Marcin Gortat\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 (@MGortat) December 26, 2015 Morris, to be sure, has been fantastic, especially in recent weeks. As Ben Standig pointed out, Morris is averaging 17.6 points and 8.3 rebounds in this calendar year, while shooting 40 percent from three-point range. He's the stretch-4 this team has needed for years, if you set aside Paul Pierce's performance in the 2015 playoffs. But he's also been more than that, according to Gortat. In a lengthy podcast with Standig, Gortat extolled Morris's contributions off the court, with a pretty striking anecdote. ['He's a meme every night he plays': Nick Young's one-of-a-kind NBA career rolls on] \"I think he's a great human being,\" Gortat said of Morris. \"First of all he's a great teammate. He's a great teammate. And a great teammate is when you're on the island, [and stuff] hits the fan. I get you my example. When I had a situation with bench players, call out the bench players and I threw them under the bus, accidentally threw them under the bus, I did make a huge mistake. I felt disgusted with what I said, and I apologized. I feel like I'm going to be apologizing till the end of the season.\" (This, of course, is a reference to Gortat's comments in November that the Wizards had one of the worst benches in the league. At the time, the team was 2-7, and the bench was indeed playing awful, but Gortat's postgame comments caused a mild uproar.) Gortat continued: \"And that moment when you're walking into the locker room and nobody wants to talk to you, that moment when everybody's look at you like 'Look at this [jerk], what the frick is he thinking?' That's the moment when you're on the island. And that kid right here, [Morris] came to me first - what's up, how you doing, how you feel, lets go get a lift, let's play music, let's get back to it. You know what I'm saying? He's the first one who come in, approach, grab your hand. And he's going to talk to you, make you feel like 'Hey, whatever, we're past that.' That's the guy who he is. People just don't understand that. And it's huge, as a teammate. It's huge.\" That's a great anecdote, and more support for Gortat's months of Morris praise. And also for Gortat's belief that he'll be a great personnel man one day. Read more context from Standig here. And listen to the full conversation, which is terrific, below.",

And now Coach Brooks is trusting Morris to put him on the floor with his reserves to bring stability to that unit.",

Hell the hell no they haven\u2019t!\n\nBeal could have taken less than five years to become an above-average pro guard. Porter, a highly accomplished college player whose draft stock was based on his readiness to produce in the NBA, could have done more with the first three years of his career than being handled like some clueless project doofus from Antarctica with elbows for fingers and a learning curve measured in continental drift. Wall didn\u2019t need to lose an entire wasted and pain-wracked 2015-16 season to his team\u2019s foolish, doomed pursuit of Kevin Durant. Brooks wouldn\u2019t have had to give the month of November to figuring out which incompetent stiff would be his first big off the bench if the team hadn\u2019t dumped a long-term contract on Ian f---ing Mahinmi right before Ian f---ing Mahinmi\u2019s body dissolved into an even more useless puddle of broken s--t than it already was.\"",
                "Actually, Otto's early struggles were mostly the result of injury and a slow start. Mahinmi apparently didn't show evidence of his physical problems  on the medical evaluation, and he started 72 games the year before. He might still  turn out OK. The team's played well without him and he might a serious asset when play slows down after the regular season.",

He's also 30 years old. It was a bad decision. The bench is both horrible and expensive. And I'm supposed to pat EG on the back for hitting on a few obvious draft picks after his completely indefensible 13-year track record? Hell no. F--- that. He's terrible.",
                "lol no pats on back required, ever. But to be fair, there are a number of positive signs re what a healthy Mahinmi is capable of, based on last season -- 59% FG shooting, 7.1 boards, 1.5 assists, 1.1 blocks, and 9.3 points, in just 25.6 minutes per game. That's not that far off from what we're getting from Marc in 35 minutes. He's about 260 lbs, 3 years younger, and used to protecting the rim. His flaw is FT shooting and supposedly he's been working on that. \n\nI'm just saying, give the dude a chance. That 16 mil may not look so awful when April arrives.",
                "Wrong, Porter has not been locked up, and he will now cost a lot more. Thanks to your great Ernie!\n\nLikewise, Beal could have been locked up early at last year's max contract, which is a lot less than this year's. But Ernie wants the cap space for the off-season splash. and see who he bring in for the off-season?!",
                "I hate to say it, but the best thing that Ernie did this year was finally sign a really good coach.  These Wall, Beal, and Otto always had game.  They just finally have a coach who can bring it out of them.  If Brooks weren't coach this, I don't think the teams record would be half as good as it is now.",

                "Sure, 4 years, $64 Million for a 30 year-old big who's never averaged 10 points or 8 rebounds/game before. Great idea. He's really earned that money so far. Sure, he's only played in a handful of games, but when he has played? Man, it's been magic. That net rating of -25.2 points/100 possessions that is 9th-worst in the League among all players? Money well spent.\n\nBut he just needs to get up to speed. He's been great in Dallas and Indiana. Wait, no he hasn't. 28th among all Centers in net rating/100 possessions last year, just a liiiiiiiittle bit worse than Clint Capella. This was a smart investment! EG FOREVER!",

Count me among the unimpressed with Ian Mahinmi. \n\nI'm not a fan of EG's general proclivity to abandon the draft, but I'm even LESS of a fan of EG's draft history outside of the top 3, so I think they at least need to offload this season's first rounder to get another solid bench body.",
                "The Wiz are already over the cap so they would have to trade some salaries to make any trade.\n\nEG hasn't been terrible on draft day lately. We picked up Oubre for effectively a 1st rounder and some 2nd rounders. Beal, Wall, and Porter have worked out. Vesely was a disaster, but that was 5 or so years ago. Sataronsky is playing. Jordan Clarkson is playing well. Just not for us. I used to think EG was a disaster, but I've changed my mind.",
                "Actually, you are incorrect.  Smith is playing well, as is Burke.  Mahinmi looks like he's still in preseason, which he is.  They do have some problems working as a unit on defense, but n general the bench has been ok.  You just have an issue with EG.  I would guess there is some background issue there that you can't say on the Post.  The Wizards are playing as well as any team in the league right now.  The coach has a good bit to do with this, but Morris is a great player, always hustling.  The big difference is Porter shooting threes, Wall is faster then ever (too  many turnovers but that goes with his style) and Beal is healthy and a year older.  They would have beaten the Cavaliers if the refs hadn't blown a big call near the end.",
                "lots of opinion in that one, not much in the way of facts\n\nEG has been awful outside the top 3 of the draft, Oubre aside. \n\nthe bench has been better than \"awful\" but still couldnt protect an 18 point lead last night.  or against OKC\n\nif you want to play the \"ifs and buts\" game with Cle, dont forget Lebron missed a wide open layup w 3 seconds left that he makes 99.9% of the time. while the shot to tie was rediculous the Wiz D got torched that night, giving up 143 pts (or something like that) in just 53 minutes",
                "Definitely, the bench has been the problem all along. But there are signs: Jason Smith, Kelly. Ian looked more like his old self, and when he's right, he's a very solid NBA center. \n\nBurke, Sato, Nicholson -- nothing yet.",

The bench actually is doing mainly what you want them to, in a minimum sense -  They are giving the starting 5 rest, while at the same time not losing too much of a lead.   That is mostly how the Wizards have been winning.  I think Smith has outperformed what he was expected to be.  The others have been streaky and sometimes disappointing offensively.  BUT, the main thing the  the bench needs to do is play good defense and avoid turnovers.   My only question is why isn't Thorton playing?  He provided good scoring off the bench early in the season.  Is he injured?",

            "body": "President Trump speaks on the phone last month with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the White House in Washington. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) There was some cosmic justice. After stringing along a slew of nominees for secretary of state, ultimately humiliating Mitt Romney, President Trump got a dose of his own medicine. The Post reports: Retired Vice Adm. Robert Harward has turned down President Trump's offer to become his new national security adviser, according to two people with knowledge of the decision. Harward would have replaced Michael Flynn, who announced his resignation late Monday amid allegations that he discussed U.S. sanctions with a Russian official before Trump took office and then misrepresented the content of that conversation to Vice President Pence and other administration officials. One factor in Harward's decision was that he couldn't get a guarantee that he could select his own staff, according to a person close to Trump with knowledge of the discussions. No, it's not normal for a high-level pick to turn down the president - publicly. [Reality will get its revenge on Donald Trump] Multiple former national security experts conjectured that the hang-up specifically was Trump's deputy national security adviser, KT McFarland, a TV commentator who has not served in government since the Reagan era. Few foreign policy professionals consider her qualified for the job. An experienced former foreign policy official tells me: \"Harward insisted on a very reasonable condition, which was naming his own deputy. Now the administration has an even deeper problem: either the next candidate will make the same demand, or he or she will appear to be weak and overly ambitious by accepting conditions Harward turned down.\" The official suggested: \"The way out of this is to give KT McFarland a nice, sunny embassy - fast.\" Just hours after President Trump said cutting loose Michael Flynn was made easier by having an \"outstanding\" person waiting in the wings, retired Vice Adm. Robert Harward turned down the offer to become his new national security adviser. (Reuters) Harward certainly knows the struggles that Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson have had hiring their own staff - neither has an announced deputy; Harward was not about to subject himself to the same micromanaging from the White House. Former State Department official and vocal Trump critic Eliot Cohen says, \"It makes it very difficult for any serious person to take the job under less reasonable conditions than Harward seems to have demanded, i.e., control of staffing.\" He explains, \"No sane person would take this extremely important and difficult job without (a) control of staffing, and (b) eliminating or neutering Bannon's shadow NSC staff.\" He adds: \"Without those things you're doomed not to frustration, but failure. The question will be whether Trump can bring himself to accept that, or go looking for a mediocrity - who will, in turn, help facilitate more failure.\" Harward's decision reflects how far the president and this administration have fallen in the eyes of esteemed national security experts, including current and former officials. The White House is without an experienced chief of staff or normal internal decision-making procedures. Stephen K. Bannon got himself inserted into the National Security Council's principals meeting; Trump plans to bring on a crony, Stephen A. Feinberg, to \"review\" the intelligence operation. The president is in the middle of a crisis of his and Bannon's making. Trump delivered an unhinged monologue at his news conference on Thursday, which re-raises questions about his emotional and mental health. [How could things get worse for Trump?] As CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted, \"A friend of Harward's says he was reluctant to take NSA job [because] the WH seems so chaotic; says Harward called the offer a 's--- sandwich.' \" Sooner rather than later, we hope that for the country's sake, Jared Kushner or Ivanka Trump (or someone else Trump will listen to) will lay it out bluntly: He can have Bannon running roughshod over the administration, or he can be a successful president; he cannot have both. Bannon has intruded into national security matters and wound up embarrassing the president with, among other things, the failed travel ban. Bannon's pro-Putin tilt is unacceptable to Cabinet-level hires, to both political parties and to our allies. That Bannon would not foresee this nor understand the folly of his effort to push Trump into the embrace of an aggressive foe is political malpractice of the highest order. He has managed to make half of the country think Trump is a Russian spy or up to his eyes in financial debt to Vladimir Putin. Trump - not unlike Bill Clinton after an ineffective first year in office - should clean house, find a heavyweight chief of staff and banish Bannon, who has no clue how to develop and implement policy, at least not any policy that withstands scrutiny. Bannon can head up Trump's political operation, or cut out the middle man and be a lobbyist for Russia.",

Follow the oil money to TREASON. This is what they are up to...\n\nExxon Mobil, under Rex Tillerson, brokered a deal with Russia in 2013 for 60 million acres of Russian land to pump oil out of, \nbut all that Russian oil went through pipelines in the Ukraine, who heavily taxed the proceeds, and were applying for admission \ninto NATO at the time.Putin subsequently invaded Ukraine in 2014, secured the routes to export the oil tax-free by sea, and took \ncontrol of the port where their Black Sea Naval Fleet is based, by taking the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine by force and not giving it back.\n\nThis was Hitler-tier imperialism that broke every international law in the free world.After Obama sanctioned Russia for the invasion, \nthey could only pump oil from approximately 3 of those 60 million acres. But now Rex Tillerson is our Secretary of State, and as of today, \nthere\u2019s information circulating that Donald Trump will likely unilaterally remove all sanctions against Russia in the coming days or weeks.\nPutin will make half a trillion (500 Billion) dollars from that much untapped oil. All pumped tax-free through Crimea, stolen from Ukraine, \nnow owned by Russia. Putin may have subverted our government just to become the richest man in the world.

(Evan Vucci/Associated Press) In her first full week as U.S. education secretary, Betsy DeVos wasted no time in getting to work to try to explain her vision for education and the U.S. Education Department - and to go after her critics, saying they want to make her life \"a living hell.\" She also said she has identified people in the department who want her to fail, but vowed not to let them. Her nomination by President Trump sparked an unprecedented backlash, and she was confirmed on Feb. 7 in the Senate only after Vice President Pence cast the first-ever vote to break a tie for a Cabinet nominee. Her backers see her as a champion of school choice and alternatives to traditional public schools, while opponents say her decades of advocacy work show that she wants to privatize the public education system. Protesters tried to block newly confirmed Education Secretary Betsy DeVos from entering a D.C. school where she was scheduled to speak Feb. 10. (Reuters) She was met with protests at the first D.C. public school she visited as education secretary, and the San Diego Board of Education decided not to vote on a resolution to invite her to visit the city's public schools. [San Diego school board pulls resolution inviting Education Secretary DeVos to visit] In a speech and several interviews, DeVos made clear that she is planning to push the expansion of school choice - charter schools, voucher programs and other alternatives to traditional public schools. In an interview with Axios, excerpts of which were published on Feb. 17, she said: \"I expect there will be more public charter schools. I expect there will be more private schools. I expect there will be more virtual schools. I expect there will be more schools of any kind that haven't even been invented yet.\" The one thing she said she didn't expect more of was traditional public schools. As far as the role of the federal government in education, she said: \"I think in some of the areas around protecting students and ensuring safe environments for them, there is a role to play. ... I mean, when we had segregated schools and when we had a time when, you know, girls weren't allowed to have the same kind of sports teams - I mean, there have been important inflection points for the federal government to get involved.\" But when asked whether there are any other issues in which the federal government should intervene, she said: \"I can't think of any now.\" As to whether the Education Department should be eliminated, she said: \"It would be fine with me to have myself worked out of a job, but I'm not sure that - I'm not sure that there will be a champion movement in Congress to do that.\" In an interview with conservative columnist Cal Thomas published on Feb. 16, the Michigan billionaire blasted protesters for the second time in the same week, saying they are \"sponsored and very carefully planned\" and not \"genuine protests.\" \"We've seen enough written that they want to make my life a living hell. They also don't know what stock I come from. I will not be deterred from my mission in helping kids in this country.\" Thomas also wrote this: DeVos believes that not teaching values and character development in our relativistic and politically correct age is a \"significant factor\" contributing to lack of achievement in many schools. She also says she has found a few \"moles\" (my word) in the department who are committed to her not succeeding and pledges to do whatever can be done to render them ineffective. And DeVos, who said in a 2015 speech that \"government sucks,\" told Thomas that no \"top-down solution\" in government works: \"I think the more states and locales are empowered to innovate and create and are unencumbered by unnecessary regulations and sort of beaten into compliance mentally vs. a can-do and results-oriented mentality, it's been repeatedly demonstrated that any type of top-down solution, no matter where you try to employ it in government, it's not successful.\" On Feb. 15, she gave a speech at the Magnet Schools of America 2017 National Policy Training Conference and the first thing she talked about wasn't magnet schools but protesters: \"Last Friday, a handful of protesters tried to block my entrance into Jefferson Middle School Academy here in D.C. While I eventually made it in, and had very constructive conversations with Chancellor Wilson, many DC administrative leaders, some terrific teachers and Principal Dohmann, the protesters' behavior is a reflection of the way some seek to treat our education system - by keeping kids in and new thinking out. \"Friday's incident demonstrates just how hostile some people are to change and to new ideas.\" [DeVos: Protesters show hostility to change, new ideas in education]",

Ms DeVos's mission is improve educational opportunity for all children. There are many solutions working together including school choice that can put us on the road to quality schools and there are many potholes in the way like the vile comments I have read here. Public education has many problems, low scores, low achievement, high drop out, and violence on campus. The political connection between teachers unions and politicans is a major hurdle, in California teachers unions are the biggest contributors to the Democratic party who control funding and in many instances dictate curriculum and policy. School districts are overloaded with high priced administrators vying for promotion. Students are secondary citizens in this environment. Remember many of the people responsible for these problems are in power now. Jim Byrns",

She has been very clear about her commitment to dismantle the public education system in the US and replace it with something else like she did in Detroit with disastrous results. As someone who was educated in both public and private schools, there is no doubt the US public schools have done the most good for the most students and their families. Of course private schools have better test scores on average. However they do so because under no circumstances do they accept challenged students. Our society benefits immensely because of quality public schools that serve the full spectrum of society.",

In today's WSJ, Peter Berkowitz of the Hoover Institution uses the same word.\n\n\"Indoctrination\", he says,  is what New Trier High School is teaching.  New Trier is having a teach-in regarding civil rights. Berkowitz says that students are being wrongly taught that whites oppress minorities. \n\nMy own interlocutor's silence on \"indoctrination\" interests me. I ask a direct question - what is \"indoctrination\" - and there is no answer.  DeVos is asked about IDEA and there is no answer. Trump is asked why he cannot mention that the Jews died in the Holocaust and there is no answer.  Even Mr. Berkowitz has no real answer to inequality, although he says that New Trier's answer to education is \"indoctrination\" and he insists that to do so New Trier misuses Martin Luther King. \n\nThis is all profoundly weird and disorienting. Trump and DeVos, et al, have stumbled upon silence and riddles as a weapon and a kind of holy cloak, as if they were savants or oracles. \n\nThey aren't. They are Oz.  NBC reporter Peter Alexander publicly fact-checked Trump in his press conference on Feb 16. Trump stumbled when he tried to answer.  People who are defending incivility in cloaking riddles must be unmasked.  Peter Alexander did it, and the rest of us must as well.",

The whole program with its standardized tests served to funnel money to private test development companies, like Pearson, which is now the 800 lb. behemoth in the room. I mean I am a Bernie supporter, and a former school Board member and I have to say I am no fan of standards, It has brought us years of teaching to the tests, and teaching content rather than creative and critical thinking. We need to pay teachers commensurate with other professionals and then respect them  and trust them to teach. Which is basically the Finnish system.",

            "contenturl": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/17/why-thursday-was-donald-trumps-favorite-day-as-president/",
            "body": "The Fix's Chris Cillizza explains why President Trump is returning to what worked for him in 2016: Campaigning. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Many people are saying that President Trump's raw and emotional 77-minute news conference Thursday was a disaster - a display of id totally unshackled from political strategy. Donald Trump is not one of those people. For Trump, the news conference was a major triumph and a big part of the reason he loves both politics and being president. For more than an hour, Trump talked up his accomplishments, mocked reporters and, generally, acted like the ringmaster of the greatest show on earth. And he loved every second of it. Need evidence? Just listen to Trump himself. \"I'll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life,\" Trump said on Thursday, a remarkably candid assessment of his lifelong commitment to the joust, the back and forth between the media and celebrities/politicians. His life is a testament to just how much he revels in it. Remember that this is the man who made up a young PR executive named John Barron to tout Donald Trump's eligibility as a bachelor. Someone who has confessed that the New York Post is the newspaper he reads first. Someone who has built a career on being talked about, being in the middle of things. Trump understands (and has always understood) that there is a symbiotic relationship between himself and the media; that, sure, he needs them but they need him - someone willing to be relentlessly, inescapably watchable - even more. Writing about the news conference, WaPo's Phil Rucker put it well: But the president also put on a show. He bantered and cajoled. He was playful, even. He waved away tough questions (\"The whole Russian thing, that's a ruse\") and cried out for \"friendly\" ones, congratulating a reporter who solicited his thoughts on the \"great work\" of first lady Melania Trump. For Trump, there isn't really good news or bad news. There is news he orchestrates and everything else. And, on Thursday, he was in command - in his mind - of the whole orchestra. Consider: 1. Even as Trump strode into East Room, there was uncertainty about whether he would even take questions at all. The event was ostensibly to introduce his new labor secretary nominee - Alex Acosta - but it became clear very quickly that Trump had little interest in talking about anything other than himself. 2. He spent more than 20 minutes on an \"opening\" statement. 3. He swashbuckled his way through scads of reporters, offering up his judgments not only of their questions but their outlets and even shows on certain cable stations. 4. Everyone - and I do mean everyone - was talking about Trump, and only Trump, afterward. Remember that for Trump, appearances are hugely important. And the appearance he gave off on Thursday was of a boss, the sun around which the political universe revolves. The president spoke to and took questions from reporters at the White House for more than an hour, Feb. 16. Here are key moments from that event. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Trump had been unhappy with his aides over the past few weeks, believing that they were on the wrong side of the media fire hose. So, he nominated his best spokesman - himself - to take back control. This account, from a terrific New York Times report on the news conference, sets that scene nicely: The news conference, [supporters] said, was Mr. Trump's best effort at spitting the bit out of his mouth and escaping the bridle of the West Wing, where he views his only way to communicate his side of any argument is his 140-character limited Twitter feed. Trump is always at his most content when he is front and center. It's why he loved the campaign trail so much. His speeches broadcast live on cable TV, his supporters roaring for him. It's why, more than 1,300 days before the 2020 presidential race, Trump is headed to Florida this weekend for a campaign rally. If Trump could have a TV channel that simply broadcast everything he said and did 24-7/365, he'd do it in a second. His formative experience in the second half of his life is reality TV; the biggest danger in that world is not being talked about, not being relevant, not being part of the conversation. Trump said as much on Thursday. \"The tone [of the media coverage] is such hatred. I'm really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such - I do get good ratings, you have to admit that - the tone is such hatred.\" The takeaway? 1. Reporters are mean to me. 2. Doesn't matter, because I get good ratings. Trump loved every one of the 77 minutes he performed in front of the national press corps on Thursday. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these news conferences rather than fewer.",

Trump was exactly right when he said the media would report after the press conference that he was ranting and raving and that's what they did..it's really pathetic the way the media gave Obama a free pass for 8 years and now they try to destroy Trump in 1 month... the media wants to annihilate Trump but he is a fighter and that news conference was brilliant in my eyes along with tens of millions of other supporters and that's what counts maintaining his base of support...the press and the establishment have underestimated Trump time after time and he will succeed in spite of the discredited media trying to fight him no matter what he does or says...really does anyone even believe anything the press writes or reports?? The press think they are untouchable and unaccountable and have a special place in our society where they can ruin people while twisting the truth to fit their biased narrative... well I for one hope Trump continues to fight them and it seems to be working, 2 polls came out that showed the majority of people polled believes the White House and not the media, Trump makes outrageous comments and the media falls for it every time lols",

Nevertheless, I think I saw two different drama/comedies playing out on the screen, depending on your prior opinion of Trump and, I'm sure in some cases, your political point of view. In one show he was not at all persuasive: narcissistically talking only about me, me, me; abusively ridiculing members of the press and their employers; avoiding answering simple questions (\"yes or no, please\"); making outrageous claims about the productivity of his first four weeks in office (\"best start of any administration ever\" or something to that effect); seemingly obsessed with the unfairness of the press's coverage of him vis-a-vis Hillary Clinton (the uranium deal with Russia); and just generally being combative and frankly disrespectful towards the fourth branch of government. Okay, that's one view of the presser. In a different view I saw someone speaking directly to \"the American people,\" with what I thought was targeted emphasis to those people who voted for him. In that view he was every bit as combative and dismissive as in the other view, but the takeaway is quite different. In that view he was extraordinarily persuasive: speaking his mind; using his own voice; being naturally engaging (hardly evasive); responding at length and with consideration to some difficult questions; outlining the initiatives his administration has taken so far; renewing commitments he made during the campaign and promising to meet those commitments; assuring the public that the people he has brought into government (some for the first time) are well-respected, highly skilled, confirmed patriots; and generally having a good time.

            "body": "During a news conference with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Trump says that the leaks that led to the resignation of Michael Flynn are illegal. (Reuters) THE MORNING PLUM: How far is President Trump willing to go in directing that the government's investigative machinery be used to go after his opponents, real or perceived? Charlie Savage and Eric Lichtblau have a good piece this morning that raises this question, by seizing on an important passage from Trump's unhinged press conference on Thursday. Trump said this: \"I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks....It's a criminal act.\" This came in response to questions about Trump's tweets on Thursday morning, in which he lashed out at the media and at \"low-life leakers\" and vowed that the latter would be \"caught.\" The leakers were responsible for recent revelations that have rocked his administration politically. Among them: The news that our intelligence services have established contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign and that the Justice Department warned that former national security adviser Michael Flynn misrepresented his contacts with the Russian ambassador, making him vulnerable to blackmail. [Trump must banish Bannon - or his presidency is doomed] Now Trump has called on the Justice Department to investigate those leakers. As Savage and Lichtblau put it: No law forbids a president from making a criminal referral to the Justice Department, but it is unusual for a president to direct the agency to open a criminal investigation into his perceived opponents or to talk publicly about having done so. The White House, under presidents of both parties, has generally restricted direct contact with the Justice Department about prospective investigations to avoid the appearance of politicizing law enforcement. Typically, if an agency believes that classified material from its own records was improperly disclosed, it will make a referral to the Justice Department, which decides whether to open an investigation. That bolded part captures something more significant than its deftly understated tone first indicates: Trump is directing the Justice Department to investigate his \"perceived opponents.\" As I have argued, this is what distinguishes Trump's vow to go after leakers from that of his predecessors, particularly the Obama administration, which did go after them very aggressively: Trump is going after leakers who harmed him politically. (The Times piece also details other ways in which the current context is different from the Obama years.) Now, in fairness to Trump, at his presser he argued that such leaks harm our national security, suggesting that this is why they need to be targeted. He claimed to be worried about future leaking of sensitive information amid difficult situations involving North Korea or the Middle East. But the leaks Trump is now decrying may have helped, rather than harmed, the national interest. We would not have known what we now know about the possible contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign without them. Given that congressional Republicans are mostly resisting any serious probe into Russian meddling in the election - and into any Russia-Trump campaign contacts - it is plausible that, if Republicans have their way, we will never know what really happened. More revelations make a full accounting more likely - and make it harder for Republicans to resist one - which we need to ensure this doesn't happen again, strengthening our democracy. Meanwhile, given that Trump knew for three weeks about the Justice Department's warnings about Flynn and did nothing to remove him, it's also plausible that he would still be national security adviser if leaks had not forced the issue. Beyond all of this, the fact that Trump directed the Justice Department to target these leaks right after they damaged him politically - and the fact that he's stating this publicly - raises questions about how far Trump will prove willing to go in this regard later. As Susan Hennessey of the Brookings Institution recently put it, Trump's calls for investigations into leakers seem to signal \"an intention to use the pretense of leak investigations to engage in political retaliation.\" This appears plausible, given not just the timing but also Trump's already-well-established authoritarian tendencies. [Reality will get its revenge on Donald Trump] Finally, there's the role of Attorney General Jeff Sessions in this mess. His Justice Department won't say whether it's heeding Trump's call for leak probes. According to top Trump adviser Stephen Bannon, Sessions was deeply loyal to Trump's agenda during the campaign. Trump's presidency is threatened by politically damaging leaks. Trump is now openly calling on Sessions' Justice Department to investigate those leaks. Meanwhile, the FBI itself - which is housed at the Justice Department - is investigating the contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign, and Sessions was an early and important player in the Trump campaign. But Sessions has yet to recuse himself from that probe. How does Sessions intend to handle all of these tangled threads? Sessions's role needs more scrutiny. And so does the unusual nature of Trump's call for this leak investigation. ******************************************************************* * FLYNN MAY HAVE MISLED FBI ABOUT RUSSIA CONTACT: The Post scoops the latest in the ongoing travails consuming Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn: Flynn denied to FBI agents in an interview last month that he had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country's ambassador to the United States before President Trump took office, contradicting the contents of intercepted communications collected by intelligence agencies, current and former U.S. officials said. Flynn's denial to the FBI was similar to what he had told Trump's advisers, according to the officials. It's unclear whether Flynn would face prosecution over this, if true, but it ensures that the press will keep pulling on this thread. * TRUMP ANGRY AT STAFF FOR FAILING TO CONVEY HIS GREATNESS: The New York Times reports that Trump wanted to face the media himself on Thursday because he was dissatisfied with how his staffers had portrayed his White House: For days, a frustrated and simmering president fumed inside the West Wing residence about what aides said he saw as his staff's inadequate defense and the ineffectiveness of his own tweets. Over the objections of some top advisers who wanted to steer him away from confrontation, Mr. Trump demanded to face the media, determined to reject the narrative that his administration is sinking into chaos, scandal and incompetence. Does Trump ever take responsibility for anything? * TRUMP'S LAVISH HABITS COSTING TAXPAYERS MILLIONS: The Post has a great piece tallying up the costs of the first family's travel habits: The unusually elaborate lifestyle of America's new first family is straining the Secret Service and security officials...and costing far beyond what has been typical for past presidents - a price tag that, based on past assessments of presidential travel and security costs, could balloon into the hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of a four-year term. As The Post notes, Trump's three trips to Mar-a-Lago so far may have cost $10 million. You cannot disentangle this from Trump's use of his presidency to promote Mar-a-Lago, which sends additional cash into his own pockets. * TRUMP FACES CRITICISM FOR PLAYING DOWN RIGHT-WING EXTREMISM: The Associated Press reports that critics are concerned that the Trump administration appears to be neglecting domestic terror threats: A list of worldwide attacks recently released by Trump's administration left off many that were carried out by right-wing extremists and white supremacists. And organizations that track terrorist and hate groups say the government focuses too narrowly on threats from the outside instead of adopting a broader approach. It would be interesting to hear from career officials at the Department of Homeland Security about this. * PENCE FACES A BIG TASK IN EUROPE: Vice President Pence is traveling to Europe this weekend, where his job will be to reassure allies of our continuing commitment to NATO, Bloomberg reports: Pence will use an address to the Munich Security Conference on Saturday to vouch for Trump's commitment to the trans-Atlantic partnership and the need to confront a resurgent Russia, an administration official said...At the same time, he also will repeat demands that European allies contribute more to the alliance. The news that our intelligence services believe Russia was in touch with Trump campaign officials during the campaign won't make his job any easier. * TRUMP FACING A 'CRISIS OF LEGITIMACY': Paul Krugman takes stock of the latest turns in the Russia-Trump saga, and observes: Trump is facing a clear crisis of legitimacy....even as the F.B.I. was creating the false appearance of scandal around his opponent, it was sitting on evidence suggesting alarmingly close relations between Mr. Trump's campaign and Russia....How can a leader under such a cloud send American soldiers to die?...a thorough, nonpartisan, unrestricted investigation could conceivably clear the air. But Republicans in Congress, who have the power to make such an investigation happen, are dead set against it. Of course they are. That would complicate the drive to cut taxes for the rich and decimate the regulatory state and safety net. Priorities! * AND THE TRUMP TWEET OF THE DAY, ALTERNATE-REALITIES EDITION: Good morning, Mr. President: Thank you for all of the nice statements on the Press Conference yesterday. Rush Limbaugh said one of greatest ever. Fake media not happy! - Donald J.

Everyone has to be a true believer and agree without question. There can be no hedging, no smoothing or trying to make the delusion(s) more acceptable to outsides ... as apparently members of Trump's staff have been doing. Trump clearly has not been satisfied with people like Spicer who make incredibly vain attempts at trying to portray what are clearly insane views and thoughts appear more reasonable and at least not completely insane. That means that when Spicer is talking to the press, Spicer's words don't match Trump's. That may be good from a PR standpoint, but it infuriates Delusional Donald, because Delusional Donald doesn't believe that his words and thoughts are completely insane when they are. Delusional Donald believes that he and only he has the straight line to the \"truth\" and \"reality.\" Trump's demand that others not speak for him or are disloyal when trying to takes the edges off of thoughts and views that are clearly insane is completely in keeping with someone who is mentally ill. This is also to say that there is no \"grand strategy\" behind Trump ranting and raving.

            "body": "\"The idea of a strong female who ends up liberating somebody who's been unjustly imprisoned, and helping bring down a powerful, evil person, I think still really resonates today,\" says the conductor Antony Walker.  He's describing the plot of \"Fidelio,\" Ludwig van Beethoven's only opera. And it resonates indeed. Throughout the 20th century, this story of a woman who disguises herself as a man to infiltrate the prison where her husband is unjustly confined (the opera's subtitle is \"Conjugal Love\") has been a beacon of heroic freedom and resistance to injustice. \"Fidelio\" was the first opera performed in Germany after the end of World War II; the prisoner's chorus, an ode to freedom, has become a veritable anthem. And more than one stage director has moved the opera to a contemporary setting - including J\u00fcrgen Flimm's powerful production, set in a 20th-century prison camp, which returns to the Metropolitan Opera on March 16.  But the plot was just as resonant in 1805 when Beethoven premiered the piece he initially called \"Leonore\" (the heroine's name) rather than \"Fidelio\" (the name she assumes as a man). In France, around the time of the French Revolution, \"rescue operas\" - in which characters are saved from perilous situations - enjoyed a great vogue. One of these was \"L\u00e9onore,\" written in 1798 by Pierre Gaveaux, a now-forgotten tenor and composer, and popular for several years after its premiere. The libretto Gaveaux used, by Jean-Nicolas Bouilly, became the basis for several other operas, including versions by Ferdinando Paer and Simon Mayr as well as Beethoven's \"Leonore;\" all three of these opened in 1804 and 1805, although Beethoven's final, hard-won version, \"Fidelio,\" didn't come to the stage until 1814.  Not everyone feels that \"Fidelio\" is the definitive take on the story; but not many people have had a chance to experience all of its antecedents. This month, however, audiences in Washington and New York will have a chance. On Feb. 19, Opera Lafayette will give the modern premiere of the Gaveaux work, which has lain nearly forgotten since the early 19th century (it will go to New York later that week). And on March 5, Walker will lead the Washington Concert Opera in the 1805 \"Leonore,\" which is the version of Beethoven's work that Walker has always preferred. If you go to the Met production, as well, you can see three different versions of the same opera.  \"It's exactly the same story,\" says Ryan Brown, the founder, conductor and artistic director of Opera Lafayette, of the Gaveaux piece. \"Beethoven had the Bouilly libretto and was working with it. What we don't know is whether he saw a copy of the [Gaveaux] score. After doing this [piece]\" - Brown has been rehearsing \"L\u00e9onore\" for months - \"I tend to think he did. But it's one of those cases - Okay, that's the same response to this situation in the libretto musically, the same use of figuration; is that just a trope of the time or did Beethoven hear [Gaveaux's interpretation] and then make it so much more complicated?\" \"Fidelio\" is one of a number of operatic masterpieces that hover between two genres. It represents an uncertain juxtaposition of comedy, with the story of the jailer's pretty daughter and her suitors, and high drama, with the story of a prisoner wasting away in a dungeon, rescued by his wife. The discrepancy stems from Bouilly's libretto, which was purportedly based on a true story (perhaps a reason it doesn't lend itself to neat pigeonholing), and every composer who has taken it on has wrestled with it. Mayr focused entirely on the humor; his opera based on this material is a one-act work he categorized as a \"sentimental farce.\" Paer tried to create a more Mozartian take that dips in and out of humor and seriousness. And this balance was one of the things that kept Beethoven struggling with the work for so many years. \"You start off with this sort of domestic comedy,\" says the WCO's Walker. \"Then you find out about the man in the dungeon, and you start thinking very strange thoughts about Rocco [the jailer]: How can he just be sort of the jolly guy whose day job is actually helping to stab somebody to death? It's the dilemma of the everyday person in that time, and still today it resonates. Ordinary, good people being put into intolerable situations.\" Indeed, it is a modern trope: the loving family man who perpetrates acts of cruelty because he is just following orders.  Beethoven's 1805 \"Leonore\" is considerably longer than the 1814 \"Fidelio\": It extends over three acts rather than two and contains several entire numbers that were eliminated from the sparer final version, including a duet for Fidelio and Marzelline, the jailer's daughter, that Walker calls \"sublime,\" and a big heroic aria for the villain Pizarro and the men's chorus. Where \"Fidelio\" is \"more symphonic in scope and more seriously heroic,\" its original version presents \"a more gradual progression\" and arguably a smoother dramatic line, Walker says. Brown is eager to present both works to his audience, as well. Opera Lafayette will present its own \"Leonore\" in the 2018-2019 season (financial concerns have led the company to put the production off for a season). In his view, the 1805 \"Leonore\" has closer links to the Gaveaux than the final \"Fidelio,\" including lighter voices. He has deliberately cast the Gaveaux opera with native French Canadian singers whom he plans to use in his staging of Beethoven's \"Leonore\" as well, to underline the comparison and forward the hypothesis that Beethoven's later, more heroic work also called for a different kind of voice. Walker, however, sees Beethoven's two versions as more closely linked; the same soprano, he points out, sang the title role in 1805 and 1814. There has been much debate about whether that indicates that the role was essentially written for the same voice type, or whether the singer's voice became heavier with age, as voices tend to do. Walker, in any case, is casting the opera with the kind of Wagner/Strauss voices that have become standard in this piece: Marjorie Owens and Simon O'Neill will sing the leading roles, with Alan Held, who sang Wotan in the Washington National Opera's \"Ring\" last year, as Pizarro. For a modern audience, the main interest of the Gaveaux opera, obviously, is to see how it anticipates Beethoven's later masterpiece. \"We kind of want to have it both ways,\" Brown concedes. \"We want people to come because they're heard of it, but we don't really want them to compare it to what they already know. I think [the Gaveaux opera] really stands up, and you see why people found the story compelling.\" And whether it's based on fact or not, the story does seem to have undergone a particular alchemy when Beethoven encountered it. \"Beethoven never had a relationship that lasted with a female,\" Walker points out. \"And this ideal of this incredible, strong woman who saves her husband through her love and devotion - he was so passionate about trying to find somebody like that of his own; he never did. I think one of the reasons he was so interested in this was that it combined two topics that were passionate for him: revolutionary zeal and the immortal beloved.\" Opera Lafayette's \"L\u00e9onore \" will be performed in Washington at Lisner Auditorium on Feb. 19 and in New York at John Jay College on Feb. 23. The Washington Concert Opera's \"Leonore \" will be performed at Lisner Auditorium on March 5. \"Fidelio\" will be performed at the Metropolitan Opera from March 16 to April 8.",

(Melina Mara / The Washington Post) [This post has been updated.] The weather will be warmer for much of Presidents' Day weekend, but it's still not a big getaway time on the highways in the D.C. region, though there's likely to be some extra traffic on Friday and Monday afternoons. The Capital Weather Gang says Saturday and Sunday will be mainly sunny with highs in the mid-60s. Monday may be slightly cooler, but the weekend weather should pose no problem for your local travels. The Disney on Ice figure skating show is at Verizon Center through the weekend, and that usually draws a good crowd to the Gallery Place-Chinatown area around the many showtimes. A protest called the Not My President's Day Rally is scheduled for 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Monday in Dupont Circle. Alexandria's annual George Washington Birthday Parade is set to begin at 1 p.m. Monday along a one-mile route through Old Town. See a map. Eight miles south, there's free admission Monday at the first president's home in Mount Vernon. See directions. Monday also is a free-entrance day at the national parks, of which we have many in the greater Washington region. [Going Out Guide: 8 things to do this weekend] Metrorail Here's the Saturday and Sunday schedule, unless otherwise indicated. Red Line. On Saturday, trains are scheduled to leave the ends of the line at Shady Grove and Glenmont every 24 minutes. From 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., more trains will be in service between Shady Grove and NoMa-Gallaudet. Trains will share a track between Rhode Island Avenue and Takoma while crews work on switch maintenance. On Sunday, regular service is scheduled. Orange Line. Regular weekend service is scheduled. Silver Line. Trains are scheduled to operate every 20 minutes between Wiehle-Reston East and Largo, but they will be sharing a track between Addison Road and Largo while crews work on communications cables. This schedule will be in effect through Monday. Blue Line. The SafeTrack maintenance project that has temporarily eliminated the Blue Line is scheduled to continue till the end of February, but the impact is a bit different on weekends. The Yellow Line Rush Plus will operate every 20 minutes between Franconia-Springfield and Reagan National Airport. (On weekdays, it operates between Franconia-Springfield and Greenbelt.) A rider approaching Reagan National from the north should take the Yellow Line train bound for Huntington. Arlington Cemetery station remains closed. Free shuttle buses operate between Pentagon and Arlington Cemetery. Yellow Line. Trains are scheduled to operate every 20 minutes between Huntington and Mount Vernon Square. The trains will share a track between L'Enfant Plaza and Pentagon City while crews work on station ceiling tiles. This schedule will be in effect through Monday. Green Line. Regular weekend service is scheduled. Metro on Presidents' Day On the Monday holiday, Metrorail will open at 5 a.m. and close at midnight. In general, trains are scheduled to operate every six to 15 minutes during the day, but note the exceptions listed above for the Silver and Yellow lines. Because of the SafeTrack maintenance project, the track between Pentagon and Rosslyn via Arlington Cemetery will be closed. There will be no Blue Line service at all. Off-peak fares will be in effect all day, and the Metro lots and garages will offer free parking. Metrobuses will operate on a Saturday supplemental schedule, providing extra service on certain routes, but some after-midnight trips on the Saturday schedule will not operate. See Metrobus timetables. The MetroAccess paratransit service will operate on its regular schedule, but subscription trips will be cancelled. So people with subscription trips should call for a Monday reservation. D.C. holiday travel On Presidents' Day, the District suspends most parking enforcement and street restrictions, but the Department of Public Works does enforce the parking rules along H Street and Benning Road NE where the streetcar operates. 95 Express Lanes/I395 HOV The 95 Express Lanes and the I-395 HOV lanes will follow the regular reversal schedule this weekend and on the Monday holiday. Route 606 in Loudoun Watch for lane closings on Sunday night along Route 606 between Evergreen Mills Road and Pebble Run Place, the Virginia Department of Transportation said. Workers will be shifting traffic onto new pavement. One lane of Route 606 will close at 10 p.m. There will be occasional full closing of up to 20 minutes between midnight and 5 a.m. This is the first in a series of traffic shifts to allow construction between Evergreen Mills Road and the future Arcola Boulevard intersection, VDOT said. These shifts also will allow the new segment of the Loudoun County Parkway to open as scheduled this fall. Georgia Avenue in Silver Spring Watch for single-lane closings on northbound Georgia Avenue between Spring and Cameron streets on Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sections of the sidewalk also may be closed during the repair of a building along Georgia Avenue.",

            "body": "Rosamund Pike, David Oyelowo and adorable unnamed baby in \"A United Kingdom.\" (Fox Searchlight) The Reelist is a column featuring Kristen Page-Kirby's musings on movies. For Washington Post film critic Stephanie Merry's review of \"A United Kingdom,\" click here. I was 23 before I was the only white person in a room. I was teaching English at a private high school on the West Side of Chicago, one with a student body that was 100 percent African-American. In that dusty, drafty classroom, I was not just a minority, but an only. Still, though I was outnumbered, I outranked the students, and we all knew it. I was the Other, but it was my turf. I thought of that during \"A United Kingdom,\" the fact-based story of Seretse and Ruth Khama (David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike). He is the king of what would become Botswana; she is a British woman who married him in 1948 and came with him to Africa when it became time for him to rule. She is, unsurprisingly, the only white person in the village. Her \"welcome\" consists in part of Seretse's sister Naledi (Terry Pheto) basically telling her to go home, as she is actively unwanted by everyone except Seretse. Ruth is clearly surprised; she assumed that, if she were nice enough, people would like her, despite her skin color. Naledi knows that this is beyond skin; Ruth is also a symbol of centuries of British colonialism. The scene is painful and brutal. What it isn't is racist. And, no, it's not \"reverse racist,\" either. That's not a thing. Racism is different than bigotry. Bigotry is devaluing someone because of their race or gender or any other quality that should be marked as \"irrelevant\" on the \"Is this a person?\" scale. Racism is codifying that bigotry into law and culture so strongly that it becomes embedded into a broader consciousness so deeply that, even when the overt symbols of racism have fallen away, the implicit bias remains. You can't see any more Jim Crow-era \"whites only\" signs, but you can see their shadows if you know where to look. Ruth, the only white person for miles, isn't a victim of racism when she's told the color of her skin and the baggage of her culture mean she needs to leave - precisely because she CAN leave. The nature of oppression is that you can't escape it without the substantial likelihood of grave loss; if fleeing only costs you a plane ticket back to England, you're not oppressed. You're uncomfortable. Ruth, in that scene, has a right to be uncomfortable. Being on the receiving end of bigotry, as she is, is neither pleasant nor deserved. But Ruth is hurt by the actions of individuals, not a subjugating system that's a blend of politics, culture, history and class. Her experience was hurtful, but it wasn't racism.

            "body": "President Trump on Jan. 22 said his administration will begin talks with Mexico about the North American Free Trade Agreement as well as border issues. (The Washington Post) On the campaign trail and in office, President Trump and his advisers have railed against countries that exploit the United States by selling us a lot more stuff than we sell them -- that is, countries with whom we have big trade deficits. The criticism has led them to pursue a confrontational trade strategy, espousing taxes and potentially tariffs that would, at least conceptually, make U.S. exports cheaper and foreign imports more expensive. Yet David Autor, a widely respected economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who actually has done much of the most groundbreaking research on how trade can kill jobs, says that if the president wants trade to do more to benefit American workers, he should take a different approach. Autor is perhaps best known for his calculations about how China's entry into the global trading market had a devastating effect on U.S. manufacturing communities. I spoke with him about Trump's trade philosophy and what he would suggest the new administration do to help workers. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. What is the biggest thing you think readers should know about the administration's trade policy? Their views are quite mercantilist, meaning they tend to view trade as a zero-sum game, where if you export more than you import, you win, and if you import more than you export, you lose. And that's an antiquated and unsophisticated understanding of trade. Why is that unsophisticated? Economists have understood since the Victorian era that the main benefits of trade come from comparative advantage, the idea that people can specialize in what they're good at, and then benefit from exchange. The principle is no more mysterious than specialization in the labor market. There's a reason I write articles and go out for good dinners, because I'm better at research than cooking. And there are people who are much better at cooking than research, so it's mutually beneficial for us to specialize. Why should every country in the world have a crappy airplane manufacturing facility when they can buy jets from Boeing and Airbus? The ultimate example of the opposite of trade is a subsistence economy, where every household grows its own food, raises its own animals, chops down its own trees and so on. But of course, as societies get more sophisticated, they subdivide work. We do that within countries as well as across countries, because some countries have expertise or cost advantages. The U.S. tends to export high-tech goods because we have strong comparative advantage there, and we tend to import labor-intensive and less skill-intensive goods that other countries can do more cheaply. So how does the administration's trade discussion contrast to that? Their measure of our failure in trade is the trade deficit with China and Mexico. That's just not an appropriate metric of success. Mexico is one of our biggest export markets. The fact that in some years we're importing a few percentage points more from them than they are from us, it's really second order relative to the benefits of trade. [We're totally misunderstanding the difference between Mexico and China] People tend to think about trade as if it's competition between companies - if Apple wins, Google loses. But that's false. Trade makes nations better off in general. Now, I want to be clear. I'm not saying that everything about trade is good and beneficial. Trade also has costs. But starting from the point of view where trade is a game where one country wins and the other loses, and the measure of your victory is how much you export relative to what you import, that's just crazy. You have to understand the fundamental reason for trade is not because you win by exporting and lose by importing -- it's that there are things that other countries make that you want to buy, and things you make that they want to buy. By the way, there is almost no evidence that NAFTA [the North American Free Trade Agreement] was substantially harmful for U.S. workers. That myth has been promulgated by people from Ross Perot to Pat Buchanan to Donald Trump, but there is not any academic support for it. On the campaign trail President Trump spoke out aggressively against NAFTA, calling it \"the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere.\" Economists have a more nuanced view of the deal struck in the early 1990s. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) So what are the costs of trade? Trade almost necessarily grows the size of the economic pie, but it also changes the size of different slices. It's quite possible for trade to increase the size of the pie by a few percent, and yet shrink some slices by 20 to 30 percent. Because we're a high-skill nation, when we trade with the rest of the world, we increase our production of skill-intensive products. So trade tends to increase the earnings of highly educated and skilled workers, and decrease the earnings and employment opportunities for less educated and less skilled workers. The gains to consumers and high-skilled workers are sufficiently large that they could compensate those that are worse off for their losses. But that process doesn't happen on its own. And in fact, it almost never happens in reality. So that's the real cost, that trade can dramatically reduce the livelihoods of a subset of people, and that is also extremely visible and wrenching. One reason is that manufacturing is geographically concentrated, so when a sector starts to go into decline, everyone in a region loses their job simultaneously, just like what happened with coal mining. It's like a small bomb going off in your downtown. [The places in America most exposed to a trade war] Meanwhile, the benefits are quite diffuse. They often mean lower prices for consumers, a greater variety of goods, more demand for highly educated workers, and huge profits for certain companies. When we all get cheaper furniture and textiles at Walmart, that's a couple percentage points in your cost of living over the next few years. A second factor is that manufacturing employment in particular is relatively high-paid work for relatively less-educated workers. They earn more per hour than similar people, and they have more stable hours. They generally are not going to find equally good jobs. We know in general as the labor market has become more skill intensive, women have educated themselves and adapted by moving quickly into other jobs. No one spends a lot of time shedding tears about the loss of all those great clerical jobs, but it is the case that clerical jobs have dramatically contracted. Women have moved on and up. Whereas for men in manufacturing, there has not been nearly as strong of an educational response. When men are displaced from manufacturing, they tend to move into lower paid jobs, or just move out of the labor market. So they really are losing something they're not going to replace in any short-term way. Thinking about trade now, there's some confusion over how much people should question the orthodoxy of free trade. It seems like you've done a little bit of that yourself, yet your description of how trade works is still very much economics 101. Here's the irony: Orthodox economics has always acknowledged that trade could be very disruptive. But that wasn't the advice given to policymakers. They were told that trade makes every nation better off - which is true - but not the caveat that it could create real challenges for certain individuals. Why is that? Because historically we had very little evidence of those disruptive effects. What we learned over the last 20 years is that what theory always said, that trade can be very redistributive, was true in spades. The shock of China's entry into global manufacturing was unprecedented in the disruption it created for U.S. communities. It created much more hardship than anyone anticipated. In the work I've done with my co-authors, we're not making the hunky dory case for trade. We emphasize you need to start by understanding that there are many potential benefits, but then you also need to complete the sentence and say that the process can be very redistributive, and if you're not cognizant of that, people can get really hurt, as they did in the 2000s in particular. So I don't not want to be on the record saying it's all good, and everyone who complains it just a troglodyte. That's not correct. You've mentioned that if we knew then what we knew now, we might have lowered trade barriers more slowly. But is that a case for raising trade barriers now? If we knew how disruptive this would be, we would have wanted to do it more slowly. The reason the rate of change matters is there is a natural ebb and flow. People retire, and young people don't enter contracting sectors. If we know that 20 years from now, no one will be driving motor vehicles for a living, we can adjust to that. If it's announced that after Monday, there will be no one driving cars for a living, that would be very disruptive. So even knowing the destination, the rate of change really matters. But secondly, no, I don't think we can put the genie back in the bottle and expect to get back a lot of labor-intensive manufacturing. Some of that would have eventually succumbed to trade or automation, because it wasn't an area where the U.S. had comparative advantage anyway, as a high-wage country. That doesn't mean you can't aggressively enforce trade agreements. There are certainly cases where countries engage in dumping, flooding the market with their products and bankrupting their competitors. That probably happened in the case of steel, tires and solar cells. The WTO [World Trade Organization] gives us a lot of leverage. There have been several hundred cases brought in the last 15 years, and many of them resolved in the U.S.'s favor. The TPP [Trans-Pacific Partnership] was a step in this direction, of creating enforceable contracts and strengthening intellectual property protections. China wasn't in it. There's no country that was happier that the TPP was shot down than China. And by the way, there was no country that was more harmed by that than Japan, with the U.S. being second. Trump's decision to withdraw from the TPP was an incredibly short-sighted and theatrical thing to do. On his fourth day in office, President Trump signed an executive order formally withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Crafted by the Obama administration, the trade deal failed to be ratified by Congress during Obama's two terms. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [Trump's pick for secretary of state argued against one of the president-elect's biggest promises] What about strategic sectors? If trade barriers aren't the answer, is there anything we can do to preserve industries we see as important? There are reasons to care about certain sectors. We ought to be really concerned that we don't lose the robotics sector to China, for example. People are afraid of robots, but whether we produce them or not, they will be here. It's just a question of whether they will be produced by the U.S., Germany or China. Since a lot of the innovation has originated here, we have an intellectual head start, but our investment is woefully behind. Manufacturing is also extremely important as a hub of innovation. It may not be a mass employer in the future, but it is still incredibly important because so many of our great ideas are produced while making new products, and a lot of our wealth comes from those ideas. One thing the U.S. ought to do is change our tax code in a way that favors domestic investment rather than simply favoring companies moving profits offshore. So, for example, the idea of replacing our payroll tax with a value-added tax, sometimes called a border adjustment, is a good one. We have an antiquated tax system that has very high, inefficient corporate taxes. Companies spend a lot of energy getting around them, and that creates huge distortions. Short animated video explaining how a value-added tax works. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) Another big step would be for the U.S. to stop cutting the legs out of its investment in research and development by gutting our science and statistical agencies. The U.S. was by far the leader in R&D expenditure and now we've fallen behind Germany. China is catching up rapidly. I wanted to ask you about automation. Some research claims as much as 80 percent of the jobs lost in manufacturing are due to automation. Do you agree? If we're talking from 1980 to the present, automation has certainly been a bigger factor in the decline of manufacturing employment than trade. But from 2001 to the present, I think trade is at least equally important. The other thing is that trade is much faster moving, while automation tends to be more gradual. Automation will occur whether we lead or we lag on it. Automation could benefit us in two ways. One is by increasing productivity. The other is that if we develop those technologies, the industries that grow up around them will create profit and wealth in the U.S. So we ought to be thinking of automation as a strategic asset. As much as we recognize that, just like trade, automation doesn't make everyone better off, it does raise national wealth, and that gives us the scope to make everyone better off. What advice would you give the new administration in terms of labor force policies?   I think steps the Obama administration was taking in terms of worker protections, safety enforcement, wage and overtime laws, and so on were important. I think it's incredibly important to retain access to healthcare and health insurance. But there's no substitute for economic growth, so I do want to see pro-growth policies like tax reform and investment. We should be investing in infrastructure and education. The way that public education institutions are being decimated is a huge national loss. And we would benefit from government investment in R&D, for example the National Science Foundation or the National Institutes of Health. There is a big role for the government in facilitating growth, and it's not just about deregulating and letting dirty industries pollute more, and letting companies give bad financial advice to pensioners. Growth isn't a matter of letting one group of people take advantage of another. It's choosing policies that make the system work better.

                "I think that one of the most important points in this article is that it takes time for people to adjust to the job losses that accompany trade.  We could slow that significantly while improving the lives of those in countries we trade with if we demanded that workers were treated fairly in countries we traded with, and pollution was minimized in those countries.  In other words, if you use child labor and dump chemicals into your rivers, you are not ready to trade with the US.  When you have reasonable labor protections and control pollution, you can trade.  This would have the effect of benefiting their people while slowing down trade enough to allow workers here to absorb the shifts.\n\nMany people would rather pay more for goods, have fewer items of more expensive clothing, etc. than see entire areas of the country wiped out by the rapid implementation of trade with poor nations.

Hey, yacht taxes fall unfairly upon the wealthy, and mortgage deductions likewise fall unfairly upon the wealthy. Except, I have no idea what \"unfair\"means in this context.\n\n Look, I don't think that you are intentionally dishonest, but I do think that you are sloppy and misleading. Why are you doing that? It wouldn't take much more effort just to be honest and accurate.</span>",
                "How would you be more honest? The taxes proposed by Republicans would be regressive as they are not proposing consumption taxes just on yachts from Mexico. They generally propose wide based consumption taxes, like sales taxes, that affect the broad population.",
                "I have not seen a single economist who did not admit the consumption taxes, in general, are regressive. If you are able to target luxury goods, that would obviously change the impact, but that is not what is being discussed.\nThe proposal is for an across the board VAT on imported goods. There are very few items that are sold in a Target, Walmart, etc, that do not have  a major import component. That is also true for cars (even if \"final assembly\" is in the US).  I am not saying we can't use import taxes to aid build domestic manufacturers; only that we would need to balance that with more progressiveness in the income taxes. But I would rather subsidize manufacturers (based on the  number of workers and their wage level) funded through a progressive tax structure.\nWhat is fair? Set a wealth/income level below which a family is struggling to get by. Then have a tax on the wealth above the level. The government needs revenue - the question is what is the ethical way to tap into the wealth of the nation. Those that have the most wealth should pay most of taxes.\nI would argue that mortgage deductions (I have one) distorts economic decisions. Without it, I may have rented longer than I did, or I may not have bought as expensive of a home. Some  of the last housing boom and crash was fueled by the mortgage deduction subsidy. In many ways, well managed rental housing is more efficient.",
                "Good points mustquestion.  Do you see much chance of that happening given the people currently in power?",
                "Two major take-aways:\n(1) the need for a gradual shift in the economics to allow everyone time to adjust. People just do not adjust quickly. \n( note: Same thing with the environment. Plant and animals can adjust to relatively slow climate change - the problem right now is that it is happening too rapidly for the local ecology's to migrate and adapt.)\n(2) to the extent that change is happening rapidly, people need an assist. That means major assistance in re-training, perhaps in re-locating to where the new jobs are (remember the migration from teh rust-belt to the sun-belt (I moved from Wisconsin to Texas)? It means providing a social net until they can adapt. In some cases there may be a provide assistance the economic losers for a very long time (subsidized through taxes on the economic winners).",
                "I agree, but the people currently in power seem more interested in maximizing their own short term gains, rather than assuming a more long range view of economic vitality for the country as a whole.",
                "Without and outside push, like say the 1964 Civil Rights Act, people often don't adjust at all. What should be clear here is that Mr Autor is not an historian. This is not the first time such disruption has happened and historically people always look back and ask \"why didn't they see this coming\". History shows again and again how humankind is often rigid and myopic.",
                "Unsophisticated, that pretty much sums up trump and his supporters.",
                "That must then also apply to Bernie and his supporters who oppose trade. Even Hillary said that if elected president she would oppose the TPP and her supporters didn't object. Since you claim to be interested in facts judging by your unsophisticated response below acknowledge that there is fierce opposition within parts of BOTH the Republican and Democratic parties to the direction that the country has gone with trade. It's very telling that Bernie competed against Hillary the way he did, that she had to change her position, and Trump's message ultimately resonated and prevailed to winning the presidency when nobody gave him a chance. Politicians who want to stay in office, enter new trade agreements, and even keep the ones we have will have to change course if they want their party to continue. The status quo is no longer politically acceptable and economically so for a large segment of Americans who vote on election day.",

Research and development, building and maintaining quality infrastructure, and top notch public education, are expensive and require tax dollars.  Those at the top do not want to pay more in taxes.  Greedy libertarian capitalists, and their tools in office, are the real problem, not trade.  \n\nDuring the 1950's and 60s taxes were much higher on the rich and our public investments far more robust.  Since Reagan, the tendency has been the reverse.  This is why we have so many people who are hurting and left behind.  They voted for Trump, thinking he would help them, but I think he's mainly interested in helping himself.",
                "There is a contradiction between \"mustquestion\" and \"In\", but more crucial is that the GOP want to dump health care, have an import duty and lower income tax. So it seems that those with incomes below the average will suffer.",

Unlike armchair politicians, academics, members of the media, and others they have experienced firsthand the destruction that trade has caused to them and their communities. Politicians and others who support these trade deals would be wise to listen to the message they sent them at the ballot box if they want their party to continue. The narrative they sold the public to get these deals to pass is no longer going to work. Neither is changing it to geopolitics because they can no longer defend the indefensible. Either policies are going to be formulated and implemented that forces trade to work for everyone or it's going to be permanently stalled or thrown into the dustbin of history.

                "Excellent research and absolutely worth reading and comprehending information. \nThis article helped me understand some aspects of international business which I did not see during my Master's in Business education, on which I spent ten of thousands. So priceless information.\nSecondly, there is a glaring example in world economy, of India.\nIn India before the late 1970, up to Indira Gandhi, their politicians were preaching what Republicans are preaching now. Indians were told to shun English and 'India First' was the mantra. To discourage imports of discretionary goods, including automobiles, high tariffs were maintained. 'Make everything in India' was the slogan for decades. India tried to make their own cars and air planes and all. They had some isolated successes but over all as a country India fell behind the rest of the world abysmally. Especially, compared to their neighbor China.\nThen in the early nineties the next generation of Indian politicians and intellectuals began realizing that the old model of 'India First' was flawed and not working. India had become a Cuba-like society. By shunning English they had compromised even their ability to interact with the rest of the world. With this new generation came the change that India opened itself, and its pool of labor resources, to the world. Major US companies, looking for a secondary outsourcing base and not putting all eggs in the Chinese or other baskets and finding that Indians were trainable, jumped right in to set up customer support centers. Was perfect timing because the computer revolution followed and we all know the rest of the history.\nSo Republican congress members especially need to read this excellent article. But it may be already too late for their cause. That for decades they've been laboring to go in the wrong direction. It will now take them some time to change their own perspective. That is only if they realize. \nUntil that time they will continue to cause tremendous damage to the USA..",

He thought France should buy textiles. Today, instead of buying gold, people buy U.S. securities. Which is great for America overall, but really for a very specific, small number of people. The fact that its led to Trump, and if this issue is not addressed, we destabilize our democracy is ignored by the professor. He and China are the actual mercantilists.

When they buy US Treasuries, they keep the interest rate low.  Thus, the overall borrowing costs for US government and business ALL are lowered.  We all pay lower costs for living expenses.  The lower interest rate also keep the value of USD low which helps with exports.",

Liberals aren't saying, sure, there's inequality but you aren't taking into account how cheap everything is.

In my view, it is due to a combination of several factors: \n1. The wealthiest class have great influence over the rules of the game and set them up to benefit themselves: tax, laws, stock market, pension, etc.\n2. Technological innovation taking away the well paid blue collar jobs.\n3. Decline of unions \n\nAs for the impact of trade on different wealth classes, just consider what the studies on the proposed Border Adjustment tax would do to the average household.  Some study suggested that they'd need to pay about $1800 a year more if that tax was enacted.  That can be considered as an estimate as to how much the average family saved by sourcing products from oversea vs buying them all domestically.  And that means the average family do benefit from the current trade deficits.",

Manufacturing employment has been declining across the globe, for decades, mostly thanks to automation.   That isn't something that can just be turned off.   It is true that same manufacturing jobs might be saved by enacting high trade barriers, but the result would likely be much greater job loss  in other occupations.",

Damian comes to us from the Wall Street Journal where he covers the White House. Since the 2008 financial crisis, he has been one of the most competitive, knowledgeable and aggressive writers on economic and financial issues in Washington. He's broken countless stories about Washington's inner workings and its relationship with the business world. He has deep experience writing about the White House and Congress, the federal budget, financial regulations, economic policy and national security. Damian also found time amid a busy schedule of beat coverage to produce groundbreaking enterprise. An award-winning 2011 series revealed fraud in the Social Security disability system and led to the arrest and indictment of more than 100 people. In the past, we have competed against Damian, and often felt a bout of anxiety upon seeing his byline on a story. Now, we're excited to see Damian marshal his experience on behalf of our readers. In this new role, he will lead coverage of Donald Trump's efforts to transform America's economy, writing about the president's budget and tax policies, his senior economic team, agencies such as Treasury and OMB, his trade and business policies, and other economic and financial issues facing the new administration. He'll work closely with other members of the Economics and Policy team as well as National's White House and Congress teams. Damian, who also has worked for Dow Jones Newswires, the American Banker and Cape Cod Times, is a graduate of Boston College and got a master's in journalism from the University of Missouri. He lives in Alexandria with his wife and two children. Please welcome Damian when he starts Feb. 27.",

            "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook, right, and PayPal founder Peter Thiel listen to Donald Trump  (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Donald Trump has a plan to make Apple's dividends great again. I'm talking, of course, about the administration's plans for corporate tax reform. Now, in theory, allowing companies to bring their foreign profits home at a much, much lower tax rate than they could today-as a prelude to a system where overseas earnings wouldn't be taxed at all-would bring in a flood of cash that could boost investment and jobs. In practice, though, it would probably just bring in a flood of cash that would boost investor payouts and stock prices. That, at least, is what Apple's Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri admitted recently. Repatriating that money, he said, would give them \"additional flexibility around our capital return activities.\" Translation: American shareholders would be better off, but American workers wouldn't. Not that this should be a surprise. It's precisely what happened the last time there was a repatriation tax holiday in 2004. Indeed, according to a 2011 Senate report, the 15 companies that brought the most money back actually cut their R&D spending and over 20,000 jobs in the three years after the policy. So what'd they do with the $150 billion they brought into the country? Easy: they paid it out to shareholders either directly in a dividend or indirectly by buying back stock. It's not an exaggeration to say that's pretty much all they did. \"A one dollar increase in repatriations was associated with an increase of almost one dollar in payouts to shareholders,\" concluded economists Dhammika Dharmapala, C. Fritz Foley, and Kristin Forbes in their 2009 study. And keep in mind this happened despite the fact that the George W. Bush administration put rules in place to try to prevent it from doing so. The problem, you see, is that money is fungible: even if I don't pay out the money I brought back, bringing it back allows me to pay out other money. The broader point, though, is that our big companies are not capital constrained. If they see good investment opportunities, they can make them-borrowing costs, after all, are still very low by historical standards-whether or not they're able to bring their overseas earnings over here at a low tax rate. In other words, there aren't any jobs they want to create but can't afford to. That doesn't mean corporate tax reform isn't a good idea. It still could be. A system that raised the revenue we need and didn't create an incentive for companies to \"move\" their intellectual property to, say, low (or no) tax Ireland would be better than one that did. But it does mean that it probably wouldn't be \"something that is so phenomenal, far beyond what people even think,\" as Trump claimed during the campaign. Which is to say that it wouldn't exactly, to quote the president again, \"turn America into a new magnet for new jobs. Instead, it would do a lot for Wall Street and the well-connected, and do nothing for Main Street and what Trump called the \"forgotten men and women\" of the country. Populism is just another alternative fact of the Trump administration.",

Trump is busy giving tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires like himself and his family.  They are cutting taxes on the most wealthy whose tax hikes were being used to help pay for the subsidies for people on the ACA/Obamacare (who don't get insurance through their employers) that helped them pay for health insurance.  Now the wealthy will get that tax cut, along with the other tax cut that Trump and repubs are giving them.  How to pay for it all?  By cutting back on programs that the working poor and middle class benefit from.  Trump has hired plenty of millionaires and billionaires to his administration, and you can bet they will put policies in place that will make their very difficult lives easier, poor things.  Cutting back on regulations will hurt consumers and the environment, but it will put more money in the pockets of the wealthy.  Some of that money may trickle down to us in the way of jobs, but in the past it has only made the income gap bigger, as rich people tend to put that extra cash into things that don't help the economy overall.  I don't feel that wealthy people should be paying less of a percentage of their income in taxes than I do.  They use the same infrastructure I do and they like it when first responders come to their aid.  They benefit from clean air and clean water.  They benefit from the protection of our military.  Taxes are used to pay for stuff we all need/want/benefit from.  When you cut taxes then we need to cut spending on these things in order to pay for it.  Then we end up with inadequate funding.  Go ahead, Trump, make sure your friends are taken care of.  I hope lots of jobs are created under your watch.

Friedman mean any attempt to distort these forces is not just likely not to produce the promised results but will cost consumers and business more in the mid and long term.  \n\nTrade wars, artificial barriers and tariffs as well as \"'currency\" manpulation will all fall short when market forces finally exert their pull.  \n\nPut another way, if all the labor which is needed to produce a widget is $1.25 and hour labor, why would any business want to be forced to pay $15.25.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass) The Washington Capitals have recalled forwards Zach Sanford and Jakub Vrana from their American Hockey League affiliate to have 13 healthy forwards before a road back-to-back set of games this weekend. Washington is coming off its bye week, having not played a game since Saturday. With Andre Burakovsky out with a hand injury for at least the next month, Sanford and Vrana, the organization's top two forward prospects, will have an opportunity to temporarily replace him in the lineup at third-line right wing. Sanford is expected to get the first crack at that. In the Capitals' last game, he scored his first NHL goal, a game-winner in the third period against Anaheim. He has two points in 21 games played with Washington this season after making the roster out of training camp. [Caps anthem singer helps create an unforgettable night for a new U.S. citizen] Sanford was drafted by the Capitals in the second round, 61st overall, in the 2013 NHL draft, and Washington then signed him after his sophomore season at Boston College. He has scored 16 points (11 goals and five assists) in 25 games with Hershey this season. Vrana, Washington's first-round draft pick in 2014, has scored one goal and two assists in 12 games with the Capitals this season after making his NHL debut Dec. 1. Vrana has scored 25 points (13 goals, 12 assists) in 33 games with the Bears this season, fourth on the team in goals. With the Capitals playing back-to-back games visiting Detroit and then the Rangers, it's possible Vrana and Sanford each get a game to make an impression on the coaching staff this weekend. It could also be an audition for the forwards to be on the roster during the team's eventual playoff run.",

                "I'd like to see Washington use Burky's injury to their advantage, the way Pittsburgh is considering using Matta's - in that by putting him on LTIR, they will be able to gain extra salary cap space to further bolster their team before the deadline - then bring him back when the playoffs start without worry of a cap. Pittsburgh could get a huge boost for the playoffs by doing that, and also moving Fleury. Washington should likewise consider placing Burky on LTIR to stack their D.\n\nIt's doubtful Columbus would help Washington address an area of weakness by trading them Prout, and equally doubtful Florida would do so by trading them Mcilrath. However, one team that's not only out the playoff hunt, but also outside the East is the Coyotes. Washington should target both Coyotes RD Luke Schenn and minor leaguer LD Jarred Tinordi. Together they didn't cost the Coyotes much at all to obtain, nor do they have big salaries - while both can later be kept by Washington or traded again in the off season. Schenn would be a perfect fit as a #6 - #7 guy - allowing Washington to send Chorney and Tinordi down to Hershey as insurance.",

                "Burky played great after sitting in the press box a few games taking notes on Hockey 101 and he's pretty much going to be out until the playoffs anyway.",
                "chokers where were they last year in team defence, not too bad, and off from this year?\nI know they have made minor changes, tweaks and they are better, but you have to agree that the Playoffs, in hockey are different, as in other sports - \nimho - you cannot compare what happens in regular season if that was true our beloved Caps would have atleast one or two Cups from the late 80's to now!\nThey need to shore up their D up more - plus\nLook at the Cubs - they had a very good regular season and they still went ALL in!\nJust be objective!",
                "I'm with you on Washington needing to beef up their D before the playoffs, to increase their chances of winning the Stanley Cup. I believe the success they're having defensively is more a combination of having the #1 goalie in the NHL along with an excellent backup net-minder in Grubauer, their forwards helping out, Orpik being healthy, and Trotz's team based system which has always been solid. But Holtby will be put under a lot more duress during the playoffs, as will their 'softer-unproven' forwards, and D-Men such as Carlson, Orlov, Schmidt, Chorney, and recent parking lot find Tom Gilbert. \n\nI know anything can happen in the playoffs; however; it makes sense for Washington to hedge their bets going into what's expected to be many hard fought battles against some really tough competition.",

Heaven forbid TW43 or (gonna barf at this one) DW26 go down in the postseason.  Sill proved himself a decent pk'er last year, and I'd bet the farm neither Sanford or Vrana would see any shorthand time.  The roster, and resulting lineups, still lack the necessary balance to go deep.",

            "body": "Enough with the complaints, Metro riders - things could be a lot worse! In ex-cop Clare Mackintosh's smashing second novel, \"I See You ,\" unsuspecting women using the London subway system are targeted by a madman. In the novel's first sentence, commuter Zoe Walker tells us \"The man behind me is standing close enough to moisten the skin on my neck with his breath.\" That's creepy enough, but the dangers will multiply for Zoe and other women who venture into a \"cramped, malodorous train,\" far beneath the city. \"I See You,\" by Clare Mackintosh (Berkley) Zoe already has trouble enough aboveground. She's 40 and divorced, with a son who's 22 and daughter who's 19. Her kids don't like her new boyfriend, nor does either of them show much interest in finding work or leaving home. Then, on the train one day, commuting to the job she hates, Zoe is shocked to see her photograph in a newspaper advertisement for some kind of dating service. There's a phone number, but when she calls, no one answers . \"I'm worried for me,\" Zoe confesses. \"I don't know what these adverts mean, or why my photograph appears in one, but the danger is very real. I can't see it, but I can feel it. And it's getting closer.\" In time the danger becomes very clear, thanks to another admirable woman, police officer Kelly Swift, who patrols the subways for pickpockets and other wrongdoers. It's a lousy assignment, but she's on probation because she attacked a prisoner, a rapist who wised off at her. Kelly's twin sister was raped in college, and she has no sympathy for predators. [What 'Gone Girl' and 'The Girl on the Train' have wrought] Kelly and her partners learn that men pay big money to access a mysterious website that gives them information on scores of women who ride the subway: a picture, along with the woman's age, home address, place of employment and the details of her commute. The site also notes how \"difficult\" a woman is, from \"Moderate\" to \"Extremely Challenging.\" The site is a stalker's dream come true. After police learn that at least two women listed have been raped and murdered, they are desperate to learn its origin and ownership. We readers sometimes hear from the unknown person behind the site, who sends out brief, mocking, anonymous comments like: You could call me a broker; a go-between; a matchmaker. And the beautiful thing is that none of you even know you're on my books. Who is this sinister manipulator? Is he (or she) someone we've met? Zoe's ex-husband, who still yearns for her? Her erratic new boyfriend? Her obnoxious boss? The nice couple next door? The older man who's dating her gorgeous daughter? When the daughter is abruptly listed on the site - with an \"Extremely Challenging\" rating - Zoe is terrified. So are we. Horrors ensue. The author Clare Mackintosh ( Charlie Hopkinson ) Mackintosh spent 12 years as a police detective in rural England, then resigned in 2011 to focus on raising her three children. She also set out to write a novel. Her first thriller, \"I Let You Go,\" published in the United States last year, tells of another woman in danger: She faces prison for something she didn't do. The book received richly deserved praise and was an international success. Mackintosh understands the complexities - the endless ups and downs - of police work and family life, and she presents them with skill and sensitivity. Beyond that, her greatest gift may be her plotting. About halfway through \"I Let You Go,\" she introduced a shocking twist that turned her tale on its ear and carried it to a new level. Now, in \"I See You,\" she hits us with an equal astonishment at her story's very end. She's a master of surprises. Perhaps because of Mackintosh's years of police work, her first two novels reflect an exceptional sense of evil; they feature three characters who, despite their charming exteriors, are pure psychopaths, creatures who would cut your throat for a dime. She offers good people, too, but it's her recognition of inhumanity that has made her books brilliant and unnerving. It's hard to choose between her novels. Read them both. What matters is that Mackintosh seems destined to do important work for many years to come.

When we talk about bar crawls and happy hour joints in Montgomery County, the focus is usually on Bethesda and Silver Spring. But in the past year, Rockville Town Center has become a much more interesting destination to meet friends for drinks, thanks to a growing mix of mom-and-pop restaurants and larger chains. [Four bars you should try in Bethesda now] Giuseppi's Pizza Plus Giuseppi's is the archetypical neighborhood pizza joint: checkerboard floors, bright lights overhead, photos of Little League and high school sports teams framed on the walls. This isn't the kind of thing you can fake; Giuseppi's has been serving Rockville families since 1990 (its original location was a few blocks west in the now-gone Magruder's shopping plaza). The focus is still on large, foldable slices covered with gooey Wisconsin cheese and your choice of almost two dozen toppings. But if you're just stopping in to grab a Hawaiian pie or a white pizza, you're missing some of the cheapest beers in Rockville. A glass - really a plastic cup - of Bud Light or a domestic beer is $2.95, while a pitcher costs $8.95; you can upgrade to New Belgium's Fat Tire or another \"premium draft\" for $3.50 per glass or $10.50 per pitcher. That's not at happy hour - that's all the time. 199 E Montgomery Ave. World of Beer at Rockville Town Center has 50 taps and more than 500 beers in bottles. (Photo by Fritz Hahn/The Washington Post) World of Beer Over the last 10 years, World of Beer has expanded to 75 locations, an empire that stretches from Nevada to Florida to Massachusetts. The Rockville outpost, which opened last summer, is the chain's third Maryland location, after Baltimore and Towson; there are four in Northern Virginia. The formula is simple: 50 beers on tap, another 500-plus in bottles, plenty of flat-screen TVs, and long tables for groups to gather around. About a quarter of the draft beers have been from Maryland on my visits, including local farm breweries Red Shedman and Waredaca. The cask-conditioned ale frequently comes from Oliver's or Jailbreak. Happy hour, which runs from 3 to 7 p.m. on weekdays and 10 p.m. to close Sunday through Thursday, means selected $4 drafts, $5 appetizers and $6 glasses of wine. There are monthly tastings and tap takeovers, including Troeg's (Feb. 23) and Southern Tier (March 30), with flights, samples and games. World of Beer aims to be friendly to beer geeks and accessible to everyone else, but sometimes it gets a little silly. Take the signature \"infusion tower,\" which allows for draft beer to be run through a chamber filled with food or spices - maybe a draft IPA that's been \"imparted with the flavors\" with of vanilla beans and orange peels. On one occasion, I found a cask of Jailbreak's easy-drinking Infinite Amber \"finished with pretzels and peanuts.\" Why would you do that to a perfectly good craft beer? Thankfully, I had a few dozen other options to choose from. 196 E Montgomery Ave. [The beer list at Owen's Ordinary in North Bethesda is good enough to be the envy of any D.C. bar] Dawson's Market I love this crazy new world where we don't just buy beers to take home at the neighborhood market, but we can sit down and drink fresh local beers at the supermarket. Dawson's Market is centered around the ideals of local and organic products, which also extends to the taps at the far end of the store. The five beers are always regional selections - I've seen DuClaw, Franklin's, Manor Hill and 7 Locks - available for $5 per pint or between $15 to $17 for a 64-ounce growler to go. From 4 to 7 p.m. on weekdays, glasses are $2 off, making this an even more affordable pit stop. (Grab some soup, barbecue or vegetarian fare from the hot bar if you're feeling hungry.) A full beer selection, including local cans and six-packs and bombers from all over, is also available. 225 N. Washington St. Finnegan's Wake Irish Pub might look like a chain, but it's a locally-owned business that pours a great pint of Guinness. (Photo by Fritz Hahn/The Washington Post) Finnegan's Wake Irish Pub \"Finnegan's Wake\" is a very important piece of Irish literature, but it's not a very original name for an Irish pub. Walking past the storefront on Gibbs Street, festooned with Guinness-logoed flags, you might think this is some sort of Ye Olde Chain Pub, decorated with stained glass from an old chapel in County Clare, or a bar salvaged from some village shop in County Mayo. Except it's not. Finnegan's Wake is owned by Terry and Vanessa Laurin, a local couple who met while working at the now-shuttered Montgomery's Grill in Bethesda; Vanessa also managed Fado Irish Pub. Their own place is a simple, one-room spot where the bartenders pour an excellent bishop's-collared pint of Guinness, the back bar holds a strong selection of Irish whiskeys, and the menu is full of corned beef sandwiches, an all-day Irish breakfast and, most surprisingly, poutine. (You can also get beer-battered fried cheese curds.) Smithwick's, Harp, Magner's Cider and house wines are $5 from 4 to 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. to close on weekdays. The Irish duo Danny Burns and \u00c1ine O'Doherty and singer Ciaran Quinn are regular performers during the pub's live shows, which currently take place on Wednesday and Saturday nights. 100 Gibbs St. Samovar It's hard to know where to begin with Samovar, a Central Asian restaurant and bar on the very fringe of the Town Center development. Chef Solijon Nasimov owned a famous teahouse in his native Tajikistan, but left the country in 1993 after a civil war erupted. The menu is full of Tajik, Georgian, Russian and Uyghur dishes. Depending on the night, entertainment may include belly dancers, singers or a woman playing violin to up-tempo electronic music. Or you may just find bored-looking staff. [At Samovar, Tajik tea house favorites are reborn] For a bar crawl, though, this is a great place to end the night. The bar infuses a dozen different vodkas, including pungent Horseradish, the tart, cranberry-like Cowberry, and sweetly citrusy Sea Buckthorn. They all go well with the two Ukrainian lagers on draft (one golden, one malty and dark) or the Dewey Decimal System of bottled Russian Baltika beers (#6 is a wheat beer, #7 is a stronger export lager, #4 is the darker Vienna lager, and so on). Far be it from me to make jokes about Soviet-style price controls, but both shots and beers cost $6.50. Wine drinkers, meanwhile, should look for the Georgian wines, which offer good value in the $8 to $9 range. There are cocktails, too, including a classic Moscow Mule, but most drinks tilt hard toward the sweet side: The bartender suggested a Russian Spring Punch, whose name promised more than a shot of vodka with creme de cassis, creme de framboise, simple syrup, lemon and champagne, garnished with raspberries. (A drink further down the list promises a mix of vanilla vodka, caramel vodka, raspberry vodka, raspberry syrup and heavy cream. You'll forgive me for passing that up.) For whatever reason, the menu has the feeling of 1990s New York, with a Cosmo, Sex on the Beach and Appletini all featured. Skip those and go for what the place does best: vodka, beers and a taste of the lands that once made up the Soviet Union. 201 N. Washington St.",

            "body": "(iStock) It was a statement made innocently enough, while discussing the taboo topic of religion during our first date. \"We should go together.\" That's right\u200a- \u200aI asked a guy who I met on Tinder two weeks earlier to take me to his church. \"Yeah, sure!\" he said. He laughed, but I was actually serious. We had arrived at the topic when James brought up a sentence I have in my profile: \"Jesus is my homeboy.\" \"What does that mean, exactly?\" he said, his eyes smiling but serious as we maneuvered around our dinner\u200a-\u200asteak and frites for him, mussels for me. \"Well, I put that in there because it seems like there are so many agnostics and nonbelievers out there who make their faith clear in their profiles, and I wanted to make it clear in mine that I wasn't,\" I said. \"I had no idea there were that many!\" he said. For the record, I am in no way the poster girl for Christianity. I grew up attending church on a more-than-weekly basis, but entering college and leaving home made my attendance sporadic at best.  The last time I attended with any type of regularity was in 2012, and my once-nightly prayers have evolved into \"God please just let me make through this one moment\" and liking the occasional cutesy-fonted scripture quotes on Instagram. But, after navigating oh-so-many professional and personal ups and downs and still being able to standing upright, I have held on to faith in God, and it has been a long-held hope of mind to find a person who feels the same way. I've dated guys who claim to believe in God. But something seemed different about James. He had actually read about God and faith over several years, and had determined himself a believer, rooted in his Catholic upbringing. \"I go through phases,\" he said of his Sunday Mass attendance at St. Augustine near U Street. \"When I don't go, I miss it.\" With that, I asked him to take me. We concluded our dinner date with a kiss goodbye on the curb, noting that our next date would be bright and early on a Sunday at 10 a.m. The following Thursday, however, I grew hesitant. \"We don't have to go, you know,\" I said over the phone. \"It was just something I threw out there. We can just go to brunch and not go to church before.\" \"No, no, let's go!\" he said enthusiastically. \"Okay then,\" I confirmed. \"We're going.\" All of my churchgoing had been with family, friends or by myself. I had never done something so ... relationship-like with a guy I'd just met. But if faith is a quality that I'm looking for in a partner, then it makes sense that I would want a date where we explore it. The only other notable Catholic Mass I had attended was in high school, during a Christmas break visit to Texas to see my dad. He is Catholic, and though our relationship has always run from nonexistent to strained, this Mass was one of my fonder memories. To see him, kneeling, praying, taking the sign of the cross along with his fellow parishioners, gave him a look of humility and humanity, two qualities I have, to this day, never seen come out of him before or since. As James and I sat shoulder to shoulder and service began, I realized I had no idea how to ... proceed. I folded my hands, but wondered, \"Will he try to take my hand? Should I take his? Am I giving him enough room?\" I decided to just breathe and observe, and concentrate on staying roused (romance aside, Mass is still an hour of being talked at, which can make even the most alert start bobbing their heads). James was conscientious in opening the hymnal so I could follow along. \"I wanna hear you sing!\" he chided me, as I had warned him before that, due to my tone-deaf nature, I most definitely do not and would not sing. He said, \"Just follow my lead\" when everyone dropped to their knees to pray, and, most adorably, seemed to truly have found peace in those tender moments. I found myself at peace too. I listened intently to the homily, which was focused on how to be a shining light to others that we encountered during the week. I really appreciated how the Catholic church made sure that if you actually took the time to come, you were going to be taught something. My time wasn't wasted, which is how I had felt in way too many Sunday sermons that focused exclusively on salvation. That may be the ultimate goal, naturally, but sometimes you just need to hear a confirmation that you're okay - that there is good waiting for you on the other side of whatever you are facing. And I felt like I got that. Once the service concluded, James and I headed to brunch. Over Belgian waffles (him) and a salmon burger (me) we shared more funny stories and faults, and discussed that darn dating albatross known as timing. We talked so long that the server eventually had to drop our check without asking, so we could move it along. We moseyed back to my car and, after a kiss goodbye, agreed that we'd be seeing each other again, soon. \"What if this could be our thing?\" I wondered. \"Church, followed by brunch, followed by a long walk? Maybe not every Sunday, but like, a few Sundays a month?\" Was this what Etta James meant when she said she wanted a \"Sunday kind of love?\" A love that lasted past Saturday night, and was more than just love at first sight? That love wasn't destined for us. James told me a few days later that while he enjoyed our time together, he felt that something was missing. I was sad, sure, but at the same time I had enjoyed doing something different outside of standard early-date fare. And no matter what, we'll always have that Sunday in church.

If you can't be together on that it is going to be a long, hard road in life.\n\nI do have one little issue with the writers comment: Mass is still an hour of being talked at.  I realize that as a non-Catholic one might go into Mass thinking that is what is going to be happening but it isn't.  Mass is a very interactive event.  It is an opportunity to hear an OT, a psalm, a NT, and a Gospel reading followed by a homily that discusses and interprets the readings.  It is a chance to ask God to forgive us for our sins and to find fellowship with other Catholic Christians.  The second half of Mass is the Liturgy of the Eucharist where a miracle takes place and common bread and wine become in essence the Body and Blood of Christ as described in John 6.  Too bad this writer didn't get more opportunities to learn about the Mass by attending more because it truly is an amazing experience when you are open to the graces that come from seeing it for what it is which is much more than 'being talked at for an hour'.",

There is NO better way to have a relationship with someone than while being in deep relationship with Christ. Im very sorry you only know the Catholic Mass as a lecture.

There was a priest that I always wished to avoid.  He would sing every \"line in the script\" in a really drawn out way.  Mass would usually last 90 minutes, and interfere with the subsequent service.  I really thought it was annoying and really turned me off from mass.  I really can't imagine anyone saying, \"Oh yeah, I really like it when that priest sings everything.\"  And let's be honest, he was messing up with the church Sunday schedule.  In my opinion, he was doing it wrong.  He was lengthening the mass without adding value.  I would greatly prefer a long winded homily giver than singing every line.  You might say I am being petty, but what if a priest had a long pause between every sentence?  I would say, Yo!  pick up the pace!",
                "Your experience with the 90-minute Mass is atypical.  A weekend Mass usually lasts about an hour.  If your dad took you to this Mass regularly, he must have appreciated it - if you were young, I can understand why you didn't.  I hope that your opinion of the value of the Mass isn't based solely upon your early experience.  The Mass is a treasure of the Church and a gift to its members.",

Sometimes, the message is that the \"fake news media ... makes up stories and sources.\" FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and \"sources,\" is far more effective than the discredited Democrats - but they are fading fast! - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 16, 2017 Other times, the message is that members of the intelligence community are leaking classified information to the press. The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers! They will be caught! - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 16, 2017 Only one of these messages can be true, of course. Are government sources leaking to journalists or are journalists inventing sources out of thin air? The sources either exist or they don't. Yet the White House is making both claims at the same time. It makes no sense, but maybe this is what counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway meant about \"alternative facts.\" Fact: U.S. intelligence officials leaked information to the Times and the Journal. Alternative fact: The officials cited by the Times and the Journal are not real. The Trump White House is essentially offering supporters two possible reasons to be angry about news reports. The reasons are incompatible with one another, but the president apparently thinks his backers won't notice or care. In another unusual moment on Fox News, anchor Shepard Smith defended CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the air Thursday, after Trump and Acosta once again engaged in a tense back-and-forth during a news conference. Trump refused to take a question from Acosta during a January news conference, calling CNN \"terrible\" and \"fake news,\" and on Thursday the president insulted the network's ratings and complained that \"the tone is such hatred.\" This was Smith's reaction: \"Treating Jim Acosta over there from CNN - an accomplished reporter, a guy I've never met but a good reporter - I mean, treating him like he's - I'm not even going to use the word. I'm not going to give Twitter the love it needs. It's crazy what we are watching every day. It's absolutely crazy.\" It is hardly stunning that Smith would criticize Trump; he has before. But it is notable that he would go out of his way to defend the honor of a competitor. The Fox News brand is built on the idea that rival networks, such as CNN, are biased and untrustworthy, and that the only place to find \"fair and balanced\" coverage is on Fox News. Trump's lashing out at Acosta and CNN is probably good for Smith and Fox News, but it struck Smith as so unsavory that he had to speak up.",

            "body": "Chris Christie stands alongside his wife, Mary Pat, and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer as Donald Trump signs a bill in the Oval Office on Tuesday. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images) THE BIG IDEA: Donald Trump has an unending need to feel like he's in total control of his surroundings. That helps explain why he's felt so frustrated and lashed out so much over the past month. The president's alpha male personality drives him to firmly assert himself whenever he can, whether in handshakes with foreign leaders or at lunch with friends. It's a little thing, but it's telling: When Chris Christie came to the White House to discuss the opioid epidemic earlier this week, Trump made him order the meatloaf. \"This is what it's like to be with Trump,\" the governor of New Jersey recalled afterward. \"He says, 'There's the menu, you guys order whatever you want.' And then he says, 'Chris, you and I are going to have the meatloaf. ... I'm telling you, the meatloaf is fabulous.'\" When Christie told that story on a sports talk radio show yesterday, the host was incredulous: \"It's emasculating. Another man tells you what you're eating and you eat it? Not acceptable! I don't care who it is.\" \"No, it's not,\" Christie replied sheepishly. \"It is the president. ... And the meatloaf is good.\" The meatloaf moment is just the latest, if smallest, indignity that Christie has suffered since he chose to endorse Trump one year ago. Trump ribbed Christie during a joint appearance for spending so much time in New Hampshire instead of New Jersey, even as the governor was under fire back home for skipping a state trooper's funeral. \"No more Oreos,\" Trump told Christie during another fundraiser last March. When Christie introduced Trump at a rally in Tennessee last spring, the candidate told him on a hot microphone, \"Get on a plane and go home. It's over there. You go home.\" To which Christie replied, \"You got it. Okay.\" The New Yorker reported last June that Christie had \"transformed himself into a sort of manservant.\" One Republican told the magazine that a friend of his on the Trump campaign used Snapchat to send him a video of Christie fetching Trump's McDonald's order. (Christie's office categorically denied this.) Christie's reward for this level of fealty was to get narrowly passed over for vice president and then, after the election, purged as head of the transition team, possibly as part a revenge play by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner (whose father Christie sent to prison as a prosecutor). Donald Trump poses with his then-wife, Ivana, outside the federal courthouse after she was sworn in as a United States citizen in 1988. (AP File) -- Like father, like son: The president's insistence that Christie eat meatloaf reminds me of an anecdote that was deep in a New York Times story last May about Trump's relationship with women. Ivana Trump, his ex-wife, recalled an episode with his dad from when they were dating: \"Fred would order steak. Then Donald would order steak. ... I told the waiter, 'I would like to have fish.' ... And Fred would say to the waiter: 'No, Ivana is not going to have a fish. She is going to have a steak.' I said, 'No, I'm going to have my fish.' And Donald would come home and say, 'Ivana, why would you have a fish instead of a steak?' I say, 'Because I'm not going to be told by somebody to have something which I don't want.'\" Ironically, Trump singled out that nine-month-old Times story during yesterday's surreal press conference. At the time, Donald went on the record to defend his father telling his girlfriend that she couldn't get the fish: \"He would've said that out of love. He would have said that only on the basis that he thought, 'That would be better for her.'\" Trump speaks beside Ben Carson during a meeting in the Roosevelt Room. (Michael Reynolds/EPA) -- Feeling under siege, Trump has increasingly put a premium on loyalty. To wit: A top aide to Ben Carson was fired and led out of the department of housing and urban development's headquarters by security on Wednesday because he wrote critically of Trump last fall, according to the New York Times. \"Shermichael Singleton, who was one of the few black conservatives in the Trump administration, had been working at (HUD) since Jan. 23 as a senior adviser. He was preparing a cross-country tour for Mr. Carson,\" Maggie Haberman and Yamiche Alcindor report. \"But according to the two people briefed, Mr. Singleton's background check had not been completed. As it was being finished this week, Mr. Trump's advisers turned up public writings by Mr. Singleton that appeared during the later stages of the campaign in which he was deeply critical of the candidate.\" An initial vetting by HUD and White House personnel had come up with the critical op-ed he wrote for The Hill. \"He answered a number of questions regarding the article and expressed remorse for the piece and support for Mr. Trump,\" per Maggie and Yamiche. \"But a second look may have done him in. On Wednesday, Mr. Singleton was presented again with the piece and told it was the reason for his termination.\" Recall that last week Trump blocked Rex Tillerson from hiring Elliott Abrams as his deputy at the State Department after someone brought to his attention critical comments he had made during the campaign. That happened despite a job interview that had gone well. (Anne Gearan has more of that backstory.) Hours after being identified as the whistleblower in the David Petraeus scandal, Jill Kelley attended a birthday gathering with Vice Adm. Robert Harward and her husband at her home in Tampa. (Bill Serne/NY Daily News via Getty Images) -- This style of micro-management is preventing Trump from being able to recruit and retain the most talented people for his administration. Last night, Robert Harward turned down Trump's offer to replace Michael Flynn as national security adviser. \"The administration had hoped to name the retired vice admiral to the position this week,\" Jenna Johnson and Adam Entous report. \"Even before Flynn resigned, the administration was wooing Harward. The hard-charging former Navy SEAL was at the White House on Feb. 8 and then again this week. Harward commanded high-risk operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and later parachuted into his own retirement ceremony from high altitude.\" One key factor in Harward's decision to turn down the job was that he couldn't get a guarantee that he could select his own staff. From CBS News: \"Trump told Deputy National Security Adviser K. T. McFarland that she could retain her post, even after the ouster of [Flynn]. Harward refused to keep McFarland as his deputy, and after a day of negotiations over this and other staffing matters, Harward declined to serve as Flynn's replacement.\" From Politico: \"According to an individual familiar with Harward's thinking, the former Navy SEAL ... turned down the Trump offer because he did not receive sufficient assurances about ... autonomy. Specifically, the source said Harward wanted commitments that the National Security Council would be fully in charge of security matters, not Trump's political advisers. ... Trump's decision last month to place his top strategist and former Breitbart CEO Steve Bannon on the (NSC) was roundly criticized as a departure from tradition. ... The individual familiar with Harward's thinking, who asked that he not be identified, cited the 'unwillingness of White House political team to be deferential to the White House national security team' and 'unwillingness of [the] White House political team to be malleable' as driving factors in why Harward demurred.\" Situation at WH -- A senior NSC aide said to me: \"I don't know anything.

Josh Rogin reported before the inauguration that Mattis had to learn from the press that Trump had selected Vincent Viola, a billionaire, to be secretary of the Army. \"Mattis was furious,\" a source said. Viola later withdrew his name from consideration. Rex Tillerson arrives to board his plane for Germany at Andrews Air Force Base. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images) -- There was a great deal of speculation before Trump took office that he planned to delegate more authority to cabinet heads than Barack Obama did because he was not as interested in the specifics of policy. But this missed the deeper truth that Trump wants to maintain maximum control. So it should come as no surprise that the White House continues moving aggressively to consolidate and seize as much decision-making authority as possible from as many places as possible, especially bureaucrats and diplomats who are not 100 percent loyal to Trump. Just yesterday, Tillerson's enforcers at the State Department laid off staff at Foggy Bottom while the secretary traveled in Europe. From CBS: \"Much of seventh-floor staff, who work for the Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources and the Counselor offices, were told today that their services were no longer needed. These staffers in particular are often the conduit between the secretary's office to the country bureaus, where the regional expertise is centered. Inside the State Department, some officials fear that this is a politically-minded purge that cuts out much-needed expertise from the policy-making, rather than simply reorganizing the bureaucracy. ... Two sources also told CBS News that Ambassador Kristie Kenney, the Counselor of the State Department and one of the last remaining senior officials, was informed that she will be let go. She is a career foreign service officer who had served as an ambassador under Presidents Obama, Bush and Clinton.\" Also noteworthy: Not a single State Department official was included in the White House meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week. From the CBS story: \"Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner - who has no regional expertise or diplomatic experience - had a greater role in the meeting than the Senate-confirmed secretary of State. Acting Deputy Secretary of State Tom Shannon was on the official schedule to take (Tillerson's) place but was then shut out of the White House meeting.\" Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter.

MORE WEST WING INTRIGUE: Mike Pence and Michael Flynn shake hands one week ago today in the White House. (Carolyn Kaster/AP) -- Michael Flynn denied to FBI agents in an interview last month that he had discussed sanctions against Russia with the country's ambassador, contradicting contents of intercepted communications collected by intelligence agencies. Sari Horwitz and Adam Entous scoop: \"The Jan. 24 interview potentially puts Flynn in legal jeopardy. Lying to the FBI is a felony offense. Any decision to prosecute would ultimately lie with the Justice Department [now controlled by Jeff Sessions]. But several officials said it is unclear whether prosecutors would attempt to bring a case, in part because Flynn may parse the definition of the word 'sanctions.' He also followed his denial to the FBI by saying he couldn't recall all of the conversation.\" -- The House Intelligence Committee is potentially expanding the scope of its probe into Russian activities in the presidential election - with the GOP chairman saying he is open to looking at Flynn. Karoun Demirjian reports: \"The statement [from Devin Nunes] suggests that the House is now open to investigating the full scope of the allegations swirling around the Trump team and Russia rather than focused squarely on how such charges ended up in the news media in recent weeks. House Democrats are concerned that their Republican colleagues are not following the bipartisan - at least for now - model being set by their Senate counterparts in vowing to fully and aggressively investigate both the idea that Russia sought to interfere in the election, and more recent reports that Flynn discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. 'It makes us look bad,' said Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.\" -- Six more White House staffers have been dismissed after failing FBI background checks, according to Politico's Tara Palmeri. \"Some of the aides were 'walked out of the building by security' on Wednesday after not passing the SF86, a Questionnaire for National Security Positions for security clearance. Among those who won't be working at the White House was Trump's director of scheduling, Caroline Wiles, the daughter of Susan Wiles, Trump's Florida campaign director and former chief of staff to Governor Rick Scott. Wiles, who resigned Friday before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. Two sources close to Wiles said she will get another job in Treasury. She's among others who failed to pass the intensive background check, which includes questions on the applicant's credit score, substance use and other personal subjects.\" -- After struggling for nearly two months to find a communications director, the White House has finally found someone willing to take the job. Crossroads Media founder Mike Dubke could be announced as early as today. Several folks who would have been fantastic in the role, and jumped at the chance to work in any other administration, previously turned it down. Among those who passed: Brian Jones (a Mitt Romney and John McCain alumnus). They just couldn't stomach the dysfunction. (John Wagner and Philip Rucker) Robert H. Michel stands in his office after he was elected House Minority Leader in 1980.

The cause was pneumonia, said his former chief of staff. Bob Levy reports: \"Mr. Michel served as minority leader for seven terms, longer than anyone in House history, aided in large part by his courtly, nonconfrontational leadership style. His amiable manner often led to his erroneous labeling as an ideological moderate, although by temperament he was pragmatic in a House that was Democratically controlled for the vast portion of his career. He developed clout as an expert on appropriations for health, education and welfare before rising to greater visibility in 1973, when President Richard M. Nixon named him chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Amid the fallout from the Watergate political scandal, the job proved a thankless task, and the GOP was clobbered in the 1974 elections.

'Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places,' Trump said. He said the administration 'had to go quicker than we thought' because a federal appeals court refused to lift the suspension on his travel ban. The president's comments and the Justice Department's request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit mean that the administration - at least for now - is pumping the brakes on the furious court battle to restore the travel ban. Instead, the administration indicated in its filing that it expects that a revamped executive order will eliminate judges' concerns, even those the Justice Department views as unfounded.\" -- The Los Angeles Times reports that the White House is zeroing in on some backdoor ways to end protection for \"Dreamers\" in a way that they think will shield Trump from political blowback: \"While Trump wavered Thursday on whether he will stop shielding from deportation people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, his aides have identified at least two ways to quietly end their protections without his fingerprints: a lawsuit brought by states, and new legal guidance that details who is a priority for deportation.\" Option one: \"Jeff Sessions, a vocal critic of deportation relief as a senator, would direct Department of Justice lawyers to review the program. ... If the Justice Department determines that DACA is not legal or is no longer a responsible use of prosecutorial discretion, the Department of Homeland Security would be instructed to stop awarding and renewing work permits.\" Option two involves the courts: \"A handful of governors are considering a challenge patterned on the 2014 lawsuit filed by several conservative state officials against the Obama administration's expansion of deportation protections. If they sue, Sessions could instruct his lawyers not to defend the program in court, exposing it to indefinite suspension.\" -- Reality check: If Sessions and Steve Bannon actually believe that either of these approaches will insulate the president, they are making another massive and breathtakingly naive miscalculation. Anything Sessions does that exposes kids to deportation would lead to the massive mobilization of Latinos in the streets and further undermine future GOP efforts to do outreach to the fastest-growing constituency in America for a generation or more. Deporting DREAMers en masse could take Nevada, Colorado and maybe even Arizona off the map in 2020. A lot of Trump's own supporters want him to go after people who came here illegally and committed crimes, not children who did nothing wrong. ICE ISN'T WAITING TO CRACK DOWN: -- \"Federal immigration raids net many without criminal records, sowing fear,\" by Arelis R. Hern\u00e1ndez, Wesley Lowery and Abigail Hauslohner: \"Oscar Ramirez and Thermon Brewster walked out of the Rising Hope United Methodist Mission Church just before 7 a.m. - when those who sleep at its homeless shelter must leave for the day. Outside the church in the Alexandria section of Fairfax County, Va., U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were waiting. As the two men and others crossed the street toward a shopping center on Feb. 8, about a dozen ICE agents ordered them up against the wall of a grocery store, questioning them about their immigration status. According to Ramirez and Brewster, the ICE agents then indiscriminately arrested seven of the homeless men - all of them Hispanic - and packed them into a van full of other detainees... \"The U.S. government said the series of ICE raids last week netted at least 683 'criminal aliens,' the first major immigration enforcement wave under President Trump. But a growing chorus of activists, lawyers and lawmakers have pointed to a sharp discrepancy between what ICE says it is doing and what immigrant families are seeing and reporting in cities across the nation: In Chicago, a student called her high school teacher to tell him that ICE had raided her home the night before, arresting her father, an undocumented immigrant whose criminal record included only traffic violations, the teacher said. In Centreville, Va., a woman told officials at London Towne Elementary School that a student's father had been arrested after dropping their son off at school that morning. In the Baltimore parking lot of a Walgreens, ICE agents arrested a barber and a local business owner who advocates said also had no criminal records. ICE has arrested at least one DACA recipient during the raids. ICE says the man, Daniel Ramirez Medina, is a \"gang member.\" -- \"ICE detains woman seeking domestic abuse protection at Texas courthouse,\" by Katie Mettler: \"A hearing in El Paso County in Texas went from ordinary to 'unprecedented' last week when half a dozen Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents showed up at a courthouse where an undocumented woman was seeking a protective order against the boyfriend she accused of abusing her. The woman, a citizen of Mexico who was living in El Paso had been driven to the courthouse by a victim's advocate from the Center Against Sexual and Family Violence, a shelter for victims of domestic abuse where she had been living. She left under arrest... \"'This is really unprecedented,' El Paso County Attorney Jo Anne Bernal told The Washington Post. It was the first time in her 23 years at the courthouse, Bernal said, that she can remember ICE agents making their presence known during a protective order hearing. The agents had come to stake out the woman, identified by her initials I.E.G., because, Bernal speculates, they likely received a tip from the only other person who knew the time and place of the hearing - the woman's alleged abuser. 'It really was a stunning event,' Bernal said. 'It has an incredible chilling effect for all undocumented victims of any crime in our community.'\" District Judge Yahara Lisa Gutierrez oversees the court that issued the woman's protective order and told the El Paso Times that it isn't uncommon for abusers to threaten to report their undocumented partners to immigration officials as a means of control. Gutierrez told the Times that ICE agents should not act on tips from abusers. \"There's no place for that,\" Gutierrez said, \"especially in family court.\" THE CABINET: -- Trump named Alexander Acosta to replace the failed Andy Puzder as his next pick for labor secretary. Acosta was assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's civil rights division under George W. Bush and is a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida. He also previously served on the National Labor Relations Board and is now the dean of the law school at Florida International University. He went to Harvard for undergrad and law school and then clerked for Sam Alito when he was on the Third Circuit. Acosta, who is Cuban and friends with Marco Rubio, would be the only Hispanic in the cabinet. -- His background is not without controversy: 1. Civil rights groups note that he came under a cloud during his tenure at DOJ in an era when the department was heavily politicized. From Jonnelle Marte: \"An investigation from the department's Office of Inspector General concluded that Acosta 'did not sufficiently supervise' a former senior division official who favored hiring people with 'conservative political or ideological affiliations' over those with more civil rights experience. 'It is hard to believe that Mr. Acosta would now be nominated to lead a federal agency tasked with promoting lawful hiring practices and safe workplaces,' said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\" 2. \"Another pitfall could be a 2004 letter to a federal judge in Ohio that Mr. Acosta sent while he was at the Justice Department, justifying 'vote caging' in the presidential election,\" the New York Times' Alan Rappeport reports. \"The practice, in which private citizens in Ohio challenged the eligibility of African-American voters, was widely seen as a Republican strategy to disenfranchise minorities.\" 3. While a U.S. attorney in Miami, Acosta was accused of cutting a sweetheart plea deal in 2008 with a billionaire investor accused of having sex with dozens of underage girls (Trump has described the billionaire a \"fun\" and \"terrific guy\"). From Politico's Josh Dawsey and Marianne Levine: \"Acosta's prosecutors agreed not to file any federal charges against Jeffrey Epstein if he pleaded guilty to state charges involving soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor for prostitution. Epstein ultimately received an 18-month sentence in county jail and served about 13 months. Soon after the deal was cut in 2008, two women filed suit claiming that the decision to forgo federal prosecution violated a federal law - the Crime Victims Rights Act - because they and other teenagers Epstein paid for sex were never adequately consulted about the plea deal or given an opportunity to object to it. ... In 2015, lawyers for the women demanded Acosta submit to a deposition in the case. The motion was withdrawn last year as settlement talks in the case went forward, but the case remains pending... \"Acosta's involvement in the saga could be awkward for Trump, drawing fresh attention to his ties to Epstein - including the financier's tenure as a member at Trump's Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago. 'I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,' Trump told New York Magazine back in 2002. 'He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it - Jeffrey enjoys his social life.'\" Scott Pruitt testifies during his confirmation hearing last month. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) -- On the eve of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt's confirmation vote to run the EPA, a judge ruled that his office must release thousands of emails he exchanged with energy company executives who he is soon going to be charged with regulating by next Tuesday. Senate Democrats want to postpone his vote from this afternoon until after they get a chance to review these new messages, but GOP leadership has declined their request. ( Brady Dennis) -- In a desperate last resort, EPA employees have been calling their senators to urge them to vote against confirming Pruitt -- a remarkable display of activism and defiance that presages tense times ahead for the federal agency. The New York Times' Carol Davenport reports: \"The campaign is not likely to succeed. Before Friday's vote, two Democratic senators ... announced that they would vote for Mr. Pruitt's confirmation, and only one Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, has said she will oppose him. But because Civil Service rules make it difficult to fire federal workers, the show of defiance indicates that Mr. Pruitt will face strong internal opposition to many of his promised efforts to curtail E.P.A. activities and influence. 'What it means is that it's going to be a blood bath when Pruitt gets in there,'\" said Christine Todd Whitman, a Bush-era E.P.A. administrator.\" Ms. Whitman predicted a standoff between career employees and their politically appointed bosses, noting that Mr. Pruitt would be blocked ... from immediately firing longtime employees, but would probably be able to retaliate in other ways, such as shifting them to different jobs. -- The Senate confirmed Mick Mulvaney to lead the Office of Management and Budget on a 51-49 vote, giving the South Carolina lawmaker one of the most powerful positions in Trump's Cabinet and the responsibility of reconciling the administration's conflicting spending priorities. No Democrats voted for him, and John McCain - citing concerns about Mulvaney votes to slash military spending - broke with his party to join them. (Max Ehrenfreund) Mitch McConnell answers questions from the media during a press conference. (Pete Marovich For The Washington Post) CONGRESS: -- Mitch McConnell weighed in on Trump's first month in office in an interview with our Sean Sullivan and Paul Kane, outlining what he sees as \"two versions\" of Trump:  \"McConnell sees ... a combative figure whose trigger-happy social media strategy regularly hurls him into controversy, and a Republican leader committed to spearheading a staunchly conservative agenda. [He] prefers to judge the second version - and does so favorably.\" \"... I kind of draw a distinction between his desire to comment on a lot of things, seemingly on a daily basis, and what we're actually trying to accomplish here,\" he said. \"McConnell offered two key examples to support his view[:] First, Trump nominated Circuit Court Judge Neil Gorsuch ... to the Supreme Court. And second, even in areas where the president has veered away from conservative orthodoxy - notably in toying with the idea of lifting sanctions imposed on Russia - he has not taken any action, McConnell said. \"The senator's comments offered insights into the complicated relationship between two of the country's most powerful leaders - and into McConnell's particular challenge: to hold the GOP together through the tumultuous early weeks of Trump's presidency.  For McConnell, seeing Trump as a helpful partner in enacting a conservative agenda may be the only alternative. Yet it's also an unproven position, given the enormous uncertainty that remains about how much the GOP can actually get done with Trump in charge.\" -- \"House Republicans came out of a highly anticipated meeting on health care Thursday morning with some new details on the options GOP leaders are considering to replace the Affordable Care Act, but not with the fully formed plan that those leaders and [Trump] have promised.\" Mike DeBonis and Kelsey Snell report: \"The meeting in the Capitol basement ... was intended to give lawmakers more details ahead of a week-long recess where many of them will be meeting constituents eager for details on what will replace the health-care law they have pledged to repeal. According to numerous lawmakers and aides in the room ... the House leaders laid out elements of a repeal-and-replace plan - including long-standing Republican concepts like health savings accounts, tax credits and state high-risk pools for the chronically sick. But they did not detail how those elements would fit together or get passed into law.\" \"It's sort of a smorgasbord right now,\" said Rep. Daniel Webster. \"The problem for the president and Republicans is that the ideas presented to lawmakers Thursday are sparking major divisions among their party. Even some of the committee leaders who are crafting the health-care legislation acknowledged after the meeting that plenty remains unresolved.\" \"We're talking different options,\" said Rep. Patrick J. Tiberi, chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on health. \"We are working together - this is not top-down; this is bottom-up.\" Asked when legislative text would be released, Tiberi said, \"To be determined.\" -- \"As [Republicans] move from talking points to details of how to abolish the Affordable Care Act, behind-the-scenes jockeying over the future of Medicaid demonstrates the delicate trade-offs the GOP faces in trying to steer health policy in a more conservative direction.\" Juliet Eilperin, Amy Goldstein and Kelsey Snell report: Some lawmakers want to preserve the federal money their states are getting under the expansion. Others argue that part of that money should be shifted to states that did not broaden their programs - or used for other purposes. Drew Altman, president and [CEO] of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, said Republicans are 'between a rock and a hard place, unless they want to spend more money to preserve the expansion and pay off the non-expansion Republican states who feel like they have toed the party line.' Some of that intraparty debate spilled into public view Thursday at a Senate confirmation hearing for health-care consultant Seema Verma to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an agency that oversees $1 trillion in federal spending ...\"  Rex Tillerson listens as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov speaks in Germany. (Reuters/Brendan Smialowski) WILL STATE STAY SIDELINED? -- As Tillerson makes his first official trip, he leaves behind a State Department that is severely weakened and cut out of key policy decisions. The Guardian's Julian Borger reports: \"Since starting the job two weeks ago, Tillerson ... has soothed nerves at the State Department by consulting widely with regional and country experts, but it has been hard to disguise the gap between the department headquarters at Washington's Foggy Bottom and the White House where far-reaching foreign policy decisions are being made. Senior State Department officials who would normally be called to the White House for their views on key policy issues, are not being asked their opinion. They have resorted to asking foreign diplomats, who now have better access to President Trump's immediate circle of advisers, what new decisions are imminent. The public voice of the State Department has fallen silent. There has not been a daily press briefing, the customary channel for voicing US views and policy on world events, since January.\" State Department staff were not consulted on Trump's travel ban, nor were they present when Trump decided over dinner to approve a counter-terrorism raid in Yemen. (If present, they could have highlighted the dangers that potential civilian casualties would pose to wider U.S. interests in the region.)\" -- Tillerson traveled to the Group of 20 meeting in Germany this week for his first trip abroad as secretary of state -- but has been forced to stay in a sanitarium. Bloomberg's Nick Wadhams and Patrick Donahue report: \"On his first trip abroad as secretary of state, [Tillerson] was forced to stay at a sanitarium in a German village known for its hot springs, 30 minutes from where other world leaders gathered. Diplomatic security agents mingled in the parking lot with elderly people in wheelchairs arriving for spa treatments. Tillerson ... was at the sanitarium because Bonn's hotels were all booked by the time he confirmed his attendance at this week's Group of 20 meeting. Counterparts including U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had to make a trek out to meet him. The unusual diplomatic debut continued during an awkward encounter with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. After Lavrov delivered some perfunctory opening remarks alongside Tillerson, U.S. aides quickly ushered reporters from the room. 'Why did they shush them out?' Lavrov asked.\" -- John Kerry has landed a new gig at his alma mater, Yale, where he will teach a course and host presentations (called \"Kerry Conversations\") in the school's global affairs department. The New York Times' Stephanie Saul reports: \"[Director Jim Levinsohn] said Mr. Kerry's class, a seminar open to students across the university, will start in the next academic year. The 'Kerry Conversations' will feature Mr. Kerry in discussions with world leaders ... While Yale's president, Peter Salovey, emphasized that the Kerry Initiative is 'not a political platform - it's a teaching platform,' Mr. Kerry, who is also writing his memoirs, has not ruled out a run for president in 2020. 'I haven't been thinking about it or talking about it,' he said. 'I haven't ruled anything in or anything out.'\" TRUMP'S WORLD: -- \"The rise of Trump has led to an unexpected twist in Germany's election: A resurgent left,\" by Anthony Faiola: \"The unconventional administration of [Trump] may be causing consternation among American liberals. But here in Germany, the anchor of the European Union, Trump's rise is helping fuel an unexpected surge of the left.  What is happening in Germany is the kind of Trump bump perhaps never foreseen by his supporters - a boost not for the German nationalists viewed as Trump's natural allies but for his fiercest critics in the center left. The Social Democrats (SPD) have bounced back under the charismatic Martin Schulz, the former head of the European Parliament who ... is now staging a surprisingly strong bid to unseat [Angela Merkel]. In a country that stands as a painful example of the disastrous effects of radical nationalism, Schulz is building a campaign in part around bold attacks on Trump. His anti-Trump platform comes as Germans are questioning American power more than at any point since the end of the Cold War, illustrating an erosion of allied faith in the new era of 'America first.'\" -- Trump's nominee for ambassador to Israel sought to assure skeptical senators that he can be fair-minded despite his previous statements doubting a Palestinian state and supporting home-building in the West Bank. Anne Gearan and Karoun Demirjian report: \"Some of the inflammatory language I used during the highly charged presidential campaign ... has come in for criticism, and rightfully so,\" said [New York lawyer David Friedman]. Asked about insults he lobbed at [Obama, Sen. Chuck Schumer], and others about support for the Iran nuclear deal that the Israeli government opposed, Friedman said he regrets them. 'There is no excuse. If you want me to rationalize it or justify it, I cannot,\" Friedman said. \"These were hurtful words, and I deeply regret them.'\" He was also asked to explain whether he supports an independent Palestinian state: Friedman had written that the goal of a sovereign Palestine is a \"damaging anachronism,\" but he suggested Thursday that the two-state idea could be viable if sought by both sides.

(Wall Street Journal) -- Fox News anchor Heather Nauert is in talks to be the new State Department spokesperson. While nothing is final, the \"Fox & Friends\" anchor - who tweeted earlier this week that she's buying Ivanka Trump heels and wearing them on air - was spotted recently at the White House to discuss the position.

The guest who impressed me was Eric Swalwell, Democratic congressman from California. His was a grueling fourteen-minute segment ... [but] Swalwell ditched the talking points and did something Democrats on conservative media almost never do: he had a conversation. The lesson was simple: Swalwell survived by abandoning his talking points and having an honest conversation. The experience made Swalwell a noticeably better television spokesperson than media training sessions for sale anywhere in the Beltway. Let's face it: Democrats are not winning. We need to stop thinking of conservative audiences as baskets of deplorables and engage them as frustrated Americans looking for a better deal. 'Engagement,' however, cannot be an empty pledge. We have to engage them where they are. And for TV, that means FOX News.\" -- The New Yorker's Adam Gopnik says the trouble with more benevolent coverage of Trump is that its \"deliberately blind to the real nature of the man and the lies he tells\": \"To tell these truths about these lies is not to assault or patronize Trump's supporters; it is to remind his supporters that they are being deceived, and are complicit in their own deception,\" he writes. \"The boy who said that the emperor had no clothes was not an \u00e9litist insulting the plebeian parade spectators. He was a truth teller trying to awaken them to what was right in front of their eyes. It is not anyone's job to pretend that Trump is anyone other than who he is in order to protect the feelings of the people he has duped. It is everyone's job to tell the truth in order to protect the country. \u00c9litist? Not a bit.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) MORE FROM TRUMP'S COMBATIVE, RAMBLING PRESSER: -- The president stunned the world in a stream-of-consciousness news conference yesterday afternoon. Ostensibly billed as an event to introduce new labor secretary nominee Alexander Acosta, the president spent 75 minutes lashing out against the media, the intelligence community, and other detractors - alternating between claims that he had \"inherited a mess\" and asserting that his fledgling administration \"is running like a fine-tuned machine.\" \"With his young presidency besieged by disorder and discord, the commander in chief was at once angry and jovial,\" Philip Rucker writes. \"Trump chided perceived enemies. He indicted leakers. He absolved himself of blame. And he excoriated the media - once the 'fake news,' now the 'very fake news.' But the president also put on a show. He waved away tough questions ... and cried out for 'friendly' ones ... Journalists trying to probe for facts, hold the president to account and correct his grandiose exaggerations in real time became set pieces in the image Trump wanted to project to America during an afternoon of must-see television: The president is in charge.\" -- Some of the key moments, via Ashley Parker and John Wagner: Trump defended Flynn as a \"fine person,\" saying that while he did not instruct him to discuss sanctions with Russian officials before the election, such behavior was \"not wrong.\" \"No, I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn't do it,\" he said. Flynn had erred, he said, by misleading Mike Pence and other government officials about his conversations. \"He didn't tell the vice president of the United States the facts,\" Trump said. \"And then he didn't remember. And that just wasn't acceptable to me.\" POTUS lashed out after being pressed on reports that members of his campaign staff had been in contact with Moscow: \"How many times do I have to answer this question? Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years,\" Trump said. \"I own nothing in Russia, I have no loans in Russia, I don't have any deals in Russia. Russia is fake news.\" He spent a large chunk of the presser attacking the \"dishonest media,\" vowing to circumvent them and speak directly to the American people about the \"incredible progress\" his administration has made. \"The press, honestly, is out of control,\" he said. \"The level of dishonesty is out of control.\" Then he spouted \"fake news\" of his own, including an incorrect assertion that he had the largest margin of victory in the electoral college since Ronald Reagan. But when confronted on his misstatements, he refused to accept blame: \"Well, I don't know, I was given that information,\" he said, by way of explanation. \"Actually, I've seen that information around.\" Trump downplayed the possibility that he will tap New York financier Stephen Feinberg to lead a broad review of U.S. spy agencies, saying that while Feinberg has offered his services, such a move might not be necessary once his national intelligence director and other staffers are installed. \"It's something we may take advantage of, but I don't think we'll need that at all,\" Trump said. (John Wagner and Renae Merle) -- When asked by an African American reporter if he planned to include members of the Congressional Black Caucus in discussions about his urban policy agenda, Trump asked her to \"set up a meeting\": \"Tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?\" he asked, cutting off reporter April Ryan mid-question. \"Are they friends of yours? Set up a meeting.\" (Ryan then pointed out that she is a journalist and organizing such meetings is not her role. \"I'm sure some of them are watching right now,\" she added.) Trump went on to say that he had been trying to set up a meeting with Rep. Elijah Cummings, a CBC member and ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, but claimed Cummings had refused to see him -- and speculated that Sen. Chuck Schumer may have dissuaded him. His comments were swiftly rebutted by both Cummings and the CBC: \"I have no idea why President Trump would make up a story about me like he did today. Of course, Senator Schumer never told me to skip a meeting with the President,\" Cummings said in a statement. (The CBC tweeted: \"Hi, @realDonaldTrump. We're the CBC. We sent you a letter on January 19, but you never wrote us back. Sad!\" They included a link to the letter.) Reporters raise their hands for questions at Trump's press conference. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) ANALYSIS: -- CNN's Brian Stelter billed the event as a \"stress conference.\" -- Jake Tapper called Trump's performance \"unhinged\": \"If you are a soldier in harm's way right now, if you are a hungry child in Appalachia or the inner city, if you are an unemployed worker in a hollow shell of a steel town, that's not a president that seemed focused on your particular needs and wants. That's a President focused on his bad press.\" -- \"[Trump] understands something very important: For his supporters, the media represent everything they dislike about American society,\" Chris Cillizza writes. \"It's not surprising, then, that at the nadir of his early days as president, Trump is returning to [his] raw and uncut attacks. ... Trump is like a comedian, forever refining his beats. He knows that if he picks on a certain guy in the audience, the rest of the crowd is going to go bananas cause they don't like the guy, either. The more personal he gets, the more they love it. I won't try to tackle whether that is a good or bad thing for democracy - or our culture - in this space today. But what I will say is that Trump's decision, amid turmoil inside and outside his White House, to turn his fire on the media was a deeply predictable move. It's also one that will almost certainly succeed in changing the subject from Russia and Mike Flynn. Trump knows all that. It's why he did it.\" -- \"I still have trouble seeing how the Trump administration survives a full term,\" says New York Times columnist David Brooks. \"On the other hand, I have trouble seeing exactly how this administration ends. Many of the institutions that would normally ease out or remove a failing president no longer exist. There are no longer moral arbiters in Congress ... to lead a resignation or impeachment process. There is no longer a single media establishment that shapes how the country sees the president. This is no longer a country in which everybody experiences the same reality. The likelihood is this: We're going to have an administration that has morally and politically collapsed, without actually going away. What does that look like? First, it means an administration that is passive, full of sound and fury, but signifying nothing.\" It also means we are about to enter a decentralized world: \"The key currency is not power, it's flattery. The corollary is that Trump is ripe to be played. Vladimir Putin was born for a moment such as this. After gifting Team Trump with a little campaign help, the Russian state media has suddenly turned on Trump and Russian planes are buzzing U.S. ships. The bear is going to grab what it can. ... We're about to enter a moment in which U.S. economic and military might is strong but U.S. political might is weak. Imagine the Roman Empire governed by Monaco. The only saving thought is this: The human imagination is vast, but it is not nearly vast enough to encompass the infinitely multitudinous ways [Trump] can find to get himself disgraced.\" -- Time Magazine cover story, \"Inside Donald Trump's White House Chaos,\" by Philip Elliott: \"For two years, [Trump] mastered the art of disruption. Name a political precept and he probably broke it during his improbable march to the White House. But disruption in government--the rulemaker breaking the rules--turns out to be more costly. In the first month of his presidency, the New York billionaire has witnessed the lesson of Samson: toppling the temple can be painful if you try it from the inside. Ultimately, Trump is the only person who can calm the storm, fan it further or just let the show go on. Aides say he would like there to be less celebrity-like coverage of every staff skirmish, and he has become increasingly concerned about the leaking, from within both the White House and the intelligence community. But he has so far resisted many binding efforts to create a more conventional order around him, encouraging aides who color outside the lines on television ... and starting each morning with a tweetstorm ...

Bloomberg reports: \"[Putin's] administration justified the decision to curb coverage of Trump by saying that Russian viewers no longer find details of his transition to power interesting, according to one of the people. In reality, some of the most popular TV segments on Trump touched on ideas the Kremlin would rather not promote, such as his pledge to \"drain the swamp,\" the person said. \"They won't pour buckets of criticism on Trump, they just won't talk about him much,\" Konstantin von Eggert, a political commentator for TV Rain, Russia's only independent channel, said by phone. \"The fate of Russia-American relations is much less predictable than it was just a few weeks ago.\" A South Korean watches TV coverage about a female suspect allegedly involved in the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's half-brother. (Jeon Heon-Kyun/EPA) WAPO HIGHLIGHTS: -- \"Kim Jong Un is a top suspect in his half brother's death. But questions abound,\" by Anna Fifield: \"For South Korea's often-unreliable intelligence service and some analysts in China, Kim Jong Un is suspect No. 1 in the apparent assassination this week of Kim Jong Nam, who was the oldest son of Kim Jong Il and had been living in a kind of exile for the past 15 years. But so many questions remain. Why would Kim Jong Un want to kill a half brother who ... had shown no political ambitions? Why would he have him killed just days before an auspicious anniversary? And why would North Korea deviate from its practice of using elite agents for such tasks, instead allegedly sending foreign women so ill equipped for the task that they didn't even know to flee? Some analysts, urging skepticism, say it is more likely that Kim Jong Nam ran afoul of the underworld in Southeast Asia than that Kim Jong Un ordered the hit. But in the absence of clear evidence either way, opinion is coalescing around that second idea. Because even if Kim Jong Nam didn't have grand designs for his future, China did.\" -- \"The Pentagon said it wouldn't use depleted uranium rounds against ISIS.

Meanwhile, New York police will keep watch outside Trump Tower in Manhattan ... Barely a month into the Trump presidency, the unusually elaborate lifestyle of America's new first family is straining the Secret Service and security officials, stirring financial and logistical concerns in several local communities, and costing far beyond what has been typical for past presidents - a price tag that, based on past assessments of presidential travel and security costs, could balloon into the hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of a four-year term.\" As Trump readies to hit his one month mark as president, here's a look at some of the costs the first family has accrued: Trump's three Mar-a-Lago trips in last month have likely cost the federal treasury about $10 million. And in Palm Beach, officials plan to seek reimbursement for tens of thousands of dollars a day to handle added security and traffic. In New York, the city pays $500,000 a day to guard Trump Tower - an amount that some think could reach $183 million a year. Earlier this month, reports surfaced that the Secret Service and U.S. embassy staffers paid nearly $100,000 in hotel-room bills to support Eric Trump's trip to promote a Trump-brand condo tower in Uruguay. -- The White House said that Trump does not plan to use the Air Force One as a backdrop for his political rally at a hangar in Florida this weekend, breaking from his theatrical campaign rallies in which his private plane was often parked behind him like a prop. (Jenna Johnson)   -- Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and the two Roosevelts, Franklin and Theodore, have kept their lock on their positions as, respectively, the four best presidents in American history, according to a new ranking by 91 presidential historians. From Karen Tumulty: \"Barack Obama took the No. 12 spot in his first time on the survey. The poll, released on the eve of Presidents' Day weekend, is the third one conducted by the wonky public-affairs cable network C-SPAN over the past 17 years. The presidents in the bottom rankings were the same as in 2000 and in 2009. They were Andrew Johnson, Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan, who again comes in dead last. Buchanan, who served from 1857 to 1861, is regarded as having been an inept and indifferent leader as the nation was headed toward civil war. Yet there was also some movement in the rankings: \"Andrew Jackson - whose style of populism that Donald Trump's advisers like to cite as a model for the current president - slipped five spots since 2009, coming in at the 18th best president. Dwight Eisenhower moved into the top five for the first time, moving up from No. 8 in 2009 and No. 9 in 2000. George W. Bush also gained slightly in the esteem of the historians, moving up to 33rd in 2017, from 36th in 2009. But he was bested by his father, George H.W. Bush, who ranked 20th. Bill Clinton, whose presidency was bookended by the two Bushes, remained in the 15th spot.\" Methodology: \"The survey asks historians to rank the presidents on a 1-to-10 scale on 10 qualities of leadership: public persuasion, crisis leadership, economic management, moral authority, international relations, administrative skills, relations with Congress, vision/setting an agenda, pursued equal justice for all and performance within the context of his time.\" SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Trump posted a picture of himself with loyalists in the House (note that there's only one woman): #MakeAmericaGreatAgain pic.twitter.com/iwkcH3BBAG- President Trump (@POTUS) February 17, 2017 Oh boy. @NewYorker's cartoon of the day. pic.twitter.com/SHfF54Kq7L- Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) February 16, 2017 Some online reactions to Trump's presser-- \"Morning Joe's\" Mika Brzezinski called Trump's presidency \"fake\": The President needs to succeed for America but he has crossed the line too many times.

His classmates say not so much,\" by Alex Rabin and Rebecca Tan: \"For years, [Trump] has said it's clear that he is 'a very smart guy' since he attended Wharton - a school he describes as 'super genius stuff.' Trump, who graduated from Wharton in 1968, has also never challenged the fact that he \"graduated first in his class,\" which various publishers and news agencies such as The New York Times have reported. Penn records and Trump's classmates dispute this claim. In 1968, The Daily Pennsylvanian published a list of the 56 students who were on the Wharton Dean's List that year - Trump's name is not among them. 'I recognize virtually all the names on that list,' [said one 1968 graduate] 'and Trump just wasn't one of them.' While some remember Trump as a studious and solitary figure, others remember an individual who was less invested in his formal education and more involved with his future in real estate.\" \"Don ... was loath to really study much,\" recalled one of his former peers. -- The Wall Street Journal, \"FBI Searches for Possible Accomplices in Probe of Fallen K Street Lobbyist\": High-flying corporate lobbyist Evan Morris is suspected of embezzling millions of dollars in what is shaping up to be a \"sprawling\" Washington influence scandal. Brody Mullins and Devlin Barrett report: Few outside Washington had ever heard of Evan Morris. Yet in the capital of wheeling and dealing, he was one of its most gifted operators. A federal grand jury has obtained records from companies tied to a prominent Washington consultant in the government investigation involving [Morris], a former drug-industry lobbyist suspected of embezzling millions of dollars... The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Mr. Morris was suspected by authorities of siphoning money from his employers, Genentech Inc. and Roche Holding AG, to pay for real estate and a lavish lifestyle of food, wine and golf. [Now, the FBI] and Justice Department are looking at whether media strategist James Courtovich or any employee of National Media Inc., where he was formerly a consultant, had knowingly assisted Mr. Morris to hide unlawful payments or kickbacks ...\" -- Time, \"At Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump Blends Pleasure, Profit and Politics,\" by Zeke J. Miller: \"The lavish oceanfront estate, to which Trump traveled for two of his first four weekends as President, is as much a part of his identity as his golden tower on Fifth Avenue or his star turn on The Apprentice. But Mar-a-Lago is not just another asset on his balance sheet. It is a monument to his wealth and status, and a restorative distraction for a restless President. For Trump, who rarely socialized in New York City and is now cocooned inside the White House, the sun-swept grounds are a sanctuary where he can bask in the adulation of paying members, who pepper the President for favors and make policy suggestions to his senior staff. Trump doesn't hobnob out of duty. Aides say it gives him a sounding board outside the Washington bubble. During the presidential transition, Trump set up shop in the formal living room, near a 1927 Steinway baby grand. Sitting in an armchair, with aides perched on couches, he would interrupt meetings to quiz passing members about possible Cabinet appointments ...\" Said Newsmax CEO and longtime friend Christopher Ruddy: \"He's in his own Shangri-la there.\" -- Buzzfeed, \"We Talked To Mark Zuckerberg About Globalism, Protecting Users, And Fixing News,\" by Alex Kantrowitz and Mat Honan: \"For years, Facebook has pursued the mission of making the world more open and connected in a largely value-neutral way. [But now,] in a sweeping and remarkable letter ... Zuckerberg signaled that he intends to more actively use his platform's power to intervene in people's lives in real ways ... Among the efforts he's pushing: mitigating polarization by presenting a spectrum of viewpoints and down-ranking sensationalized news; fighting bullying; preventing people from harming themselves or others by creating systems to pick out signs of intent among users to harm themselves or others; building AI that can detect terrorist recruitment; and building 'the long-term social infrastructure to bring humanity together' in a world increasingly questioning the merits of globalization. Some of what's in Zuckerberg's letter will be viewed as too far-reaching, invasive, or even creepy. Some of it will be viewed as na\u00efve ... But both in the letter and in person, Zuckerberg makes clear that he intends to exercise the influence and scale of Facebook's massive platform in ways that will reach far beyond the digital world.\" -- New York Times, \"Bad Brides,\" by Lena Dunham: \"On July 22, 1912, a short but not so sweet wedding announcement appeared in The New York Times: 'There was a double wedding last evening in the Oneida County Jail at Rome. The women are serving short sentences, and ... will have to spend the first part of their honeymoon in jail. The husbands are not prisoners.' We've all heard plenty of stories about women who marry male prisoners - wardens seduced by sweet-talking inmates, vulnerable housewives with multiple children who fall for convicted murderers they meet on special dating sites. Heck, even Charles Manson had a beautiful young bride-to-be (though reports said she was caught two-timing him with one of his disciples at a rock and gem show and had plans to display his corpse for profit after his death, so who knows where that's at). You don't have to have a doctorate in psychology to understand the narratives that might persuade a woman to marry a felon. But love is complex, love involves forgiveness, and so many women have been trained to forgive ... Women have also been trained to be good.\" QUOTE DU JOUR: \"For someone interested in history's bravest revolutionaries and the power of art to disrupt the status quo, I sure am eager to pay for everyone's lunch.\" HOT ON THE LEFT: \"Karlie Kloss Appears As a Geisha in Vogue's Diversity Issue,\" from New York Magazine: \"In the March issue of Vogue - the theme of which is allegedly 'diversity' - there seems to be an egregious misunderstanding of what that concept actually means. One thing's for certain: Embracing diversity does not mean styling Karlie Kloss as a geisha. Kloss was shot in Japan by Mikael Jansson and styled by Phyllis Posnick for the spread. One photo features a sumo wrestler, another has Kloss with a long crown of black hair, and another has her walking down the stairs of a tea house, all while dressed as a geisha ... Vogue has a history of publishing tone-deaf fashion editorials - remember the slave-earrings incident? Lara Stone in blackface for French Vogue? - but one would think that designing an entire issue around 'diversity' would have stopped this editorial before it even started. Apparently not.\"   HOT ON THE RIGHT: \"Obama Appointees Preventing Mattis From Rebuilding The Military, Says Armed Services Chair,\" from the Daily Caller: \"Holdovers from the Obama administration in the Pentagon are hampering efforts to fix the military's major readiness problem, leaving Secretary of Defense James Mattis alone in his efforts to properly equip U.S. forces, according to the chairman of the House Committee on Armed Services. 'I am concerned that ... to fix these problems [it] is going to take a lot more money, and yet a lot of the folks who are coming up with the budget to fix them are the same people who have been fighting every step of the way against our efforts to fix these problems,' said Chairman Mac Thornberry during a Capitol Hill press gaggle Thursday. He added that there are some people, including \"political appointees and others from the Obama administration,' who have been 'trying to deny there was a problem.'\"   DAYBOOK: At the White House: Trump will travel to North Charleston, South Carolina to meet with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. He'll tour the facility and deliver remarks at the unveiling of a new 787 Boeing Dreamliner before departing for Mar-a-Lago. Pence is flying to Europe for meetings in Munich and Brussels. QUOTE OF THE DAY: Even Paul LePage, whose brash and combative persona has often prompted comparisons to Trump, says he is growing weary of the president's shtick: \"The thing I'm sensing is that there's three or four chiefs at the top,\" the Maine governor told a local radio station. \"I would say this: You've got to put someone somebody in charge!\" (CNN)    NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.: -- Mostly sunny and calm weather to kick off the weekend on a spring-like note! The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: \"Winds calm to around 5 mph, luckily, as they blow in from the southwesterly direction. Periodic clouds can't be ruled out, but sunshine should dominate the sky for most of the day. Many of us will enjoy temperatures getting into a fairly comfortable regime for this time of year. We're talking near 50 to mid-50s. Enjoy!\" -- A bill to offer D.C. workers eight weeks of paid family leave is slated to become law. It still must clear Congress as a final step, though observers noted that Republican lawmakers - who have expressed interest in overturning Washington's assisted suicide law and rolling back its gun laws - were unlikely to intervene.

Forget the plot-line from \u201cSeven Days in May\u201d (1962). I am myself retired Army, continue to move in military social-circles, and have a sense of their devotion to the rule of law. Almost all military personnel, Intelligence community officials, and Judicial officers deeply understand and embrace their Oath of Office (LTC Oliver North aside), whereas Donald J. Trump thinks and acts upon it like a Sixth-Grader. If anything, Trump\u2019s chaotic irrationality will stiffen resistance throughout the Judiciary and the Intelligence community.\n\nMy view is that his manifest Narcissism and incompetence will paralyze government, further divide the GOP Congressional majorities, and lead to a Recessionary relapse.  The 21 remaining months before the 2018 Midterm elections will be so dysfunctional and chaotic that Trump and GOP promises will go unfulfilled, eligible voter turnout will exceed 68%, and large Democratic majorities will regain control of Congress. Using the tools provided by the Constitution, that new Congress could easily remove Trump and a variety of Cabinet officers, thereby leaving a constrained President Pence nominally in charge. With a neutered President Pence serving out the remainder of Trump\u2019s term, a measure of predictability would return, and the tanking economy could stabilize. What all that would do to set the table for the 2020 election is up for grabs.",

            "body": "Gonzaga freshman forward Terrance Williams is a versatile offensive player with high expectations for himself. (Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post) Who Terrance Williams' favorite basketball player is lends a lot of insight into the player he wants to be. Gonzaga's 6-foot-7 freshman forward is still growing, which could mean he winds up the height of a traditional center. He is already stretching defenses with his outside touch, so it wouldn't be surprising if he modeled his game after shooting big men like the Kings' DeMarcus Cousins, the Nets' Brook Lopez or the Grizzlies' Marc Gasol. But instead Williams says he studies tape of Duke freshman Jayson Tatum, a 6-foot-8 Swiss Army knife averaging 16.8 points per game for the Blue Devils. \"I don't think shooting the ball is enough, even at my size,\" Williams said. \"I want to handle the ball, I want to move the ball, I want to be a wing. I think Jayson Tatum's game is really smooth and I think my game is like that, too. And I think it can be no matter what size I am.\" The evolution of the big man is ongoing across all levels of basketball, and it's clear that prospects who traditionally would have been considered forwards or centers because of their size are no longer caged inside the paint. Now that a majority of centers and power forwards can stretch the floor, players like Tatum - tall wings who push the ball, shoot and guard up to five positions - are sprinkled across the sport. That is how Williams sees himself, and he hopes to garner more recruiting attention by filling that mold for the No. 3 Eagles (22-5, 14-3 Washington Catholic Athletic Conference). He currently has no scholarship offers but has received interest from Virginia, Penn State, George Mason and Tulane. \"He's not a traditional post player,\" Gonzaga Coach Steve Turner said. \"He's going to be a kid that stretches out to the wing and he has those skill sets already. So it's a luxury being able to have a double-edged sword with a kid that is able to play inside but can also stretch people out with his shot.\" Williams still mostly finds himself playing in the short corner or high post. He's a regular off-the-bench pick-and-roll partner for Gonzaga point guard Chris Lykes, and often gets open looks by popping to the perimeter. In a 72-57 win over Paul VI on Tuesday, Williams netted 12 points including a three and fast-break dunk. In an 82-75 loss at DeMatha on Thursday, he chipped in six points while mostly operating in and around the paint. But he doesn't want to be a \"stretch forward.\" That label, to him, lacks depth and distinction. He plans to use both the high school and AAU circuits to experiment. Williams plays for Team Takeover, and coach Keith Stevens is already pushing him to expand on offense and defense. Last summer, Stevens asked Williams to play on the wing and be a vocal  leader, two roles outside his comfort zone. The result, so far, is an assured teenager with keen foresight. Six-foot-7 freshmen are no longer told to play with their backs to the basket, stalking the paint on defense and shunning the three-point line at all costs. And that's good, because Williams wouldn't be too interested in that role. \"I feel like I can do a lot of things to help my team win basketball games,\" Williams said. \"And what I do can change from night to night, but I want to make sure I can do everything a coach would need from me. That's my goal.\" NUMBER CRUNCH: 59 That's how many combined points Ryan Allen and D.J. Harvey scored for DeMatha in its win over Gonzaga. Allen, a Delaware commit, poured in a game-high 34 and nailed six threes. Harvey, a Notre Dame commit, scored 25 and was 6-for-6 from the line.

            "body": "Will Arnett's Caped Crusader in the new \"Lego Batman Movie,\" with Superman (voiced by Channing Tatum). (courtesy of Warner Bros./DC 2017) FOR A TRUE Bat-fan, one of the best aspects of \"The Lego Batman Movie\" is that it packs frame after frame with nods to the Caped Crusader's rich lore across nearly eight decades of pop-culture iterations. Of those scores of lovingly placed Easter eggs, here are our favorites: 1. From Crowe to Bat. In \"The Dark Knight,\" Heath Ledger's Joker memorably says to Christian Bale's Batman: \"What would I do without you? Go back to ripping off mob dealers? ... You complete me!\" \"Lego Batman\" hilariously sends up Joker's neediness for a Batman relationship by having plastic Bruce Wayne, in front of his Batcave big screen, laugh at Tom Cruise's \"You complete me\" line from Cameron Crowe's \"Jerry Maguire.\" 2. Egghead! Beyond even the Batusi - Batman's campy spoof of the '60s dance craze the Watusi - our favorite nod to the '60s \"Batman\" TV show is the appearance of the \"world's smartest criminal,\" Edgar Head, a.k.a. Egghead - a role originated by Vincent Price for the series. ['The Lego Batman Movie' is all fun with none of the standard Dark Knight drama] 3. Gonna need a bigger bottle. \"Lego Batman\" has no use for the shark repellent bat spray - until, that is, Robin later finds it awfully handy. The bottle to ward off Jaws is a swell nod to when the TV series just may have jumped the (rubber) shark.   4. Passing muster. \"Lego Batman\" gets physical-comedy mileage out of the Condiment King - one of a slew of lesser-known villains shown in quick succession. The shock-inducing Condiment King, squirting his potentially lethal ketchup, became awesome sauce as created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm for \"Batman: The Animated Series.\" Batman and Robin (Michael Cera) in \"The Lego Batman Movie.\" (Warner Bros. Pictures) 5. Door-to-score delivery. \"Lego Batman's\" many nods to Richard Donner's 1970s and '80s Superman films include the icy Fortress of Solitude, at which, when the Dynamic Duo hit the doorbell, the \"Superman\" theme - from John Williams's Oscar-nominated score - peals forth like nostalgic glory. 6. There will be Bl\u00fcdhaven. \"Lego Batman\" name-checks Bl\u00fcdhaven, the neighboring town - introduced in \"Nightwing\" Vol. 2 (1996) - even more vile than Gotham, according to Dick Grayson. In \"Lego Batman,\" we learn that new commish Barbara Gordon has come from Bl\u00fcdhaven. (We also see Robin try a costume that foreshadows his future Nightwing status.) \"Lego Batman\" mocks the premise of \"Suicide Squad.\" (Courtesy of Warner Bros.) 7. That \"Suicide Squad\" jab. How can Gotham be saved? Lego Batman says that using criminals to take down other criminals is a dumb idea - a direct dig at \"Suicide Squad\" that, regardless of the snarky tone, seems delivered out of true fanboy love. 8. Bill Finger gets credit - at last! For decades, Bill Finger could not score long-due credit as co-creator of the Batman characters. DC Comics long refused to officially acknowledge just how much the late cartoonist contributed, after creator Bob Kane long claimed more than his share of the credit. With \"Lego Batman,\" Finger gets proper screen credit, and we even see some of his great side characters like Calendar Man. Congratulations, Mr. Finger.

            "body": "Nathan Williams, a founder of the Town Hall Project. (Courtesy of Nathan Williams) Nathan Williams is no novice to the political process. But suddenly there's a crop of people newly engaged and eager to participate, and since the November election, he's been looking for ways to help those people channel their desired activism. He just didn't know one idea would turn into a full-time endeavor. The 36-year-old freelance filmmaker, who has worked on political campaigns off and on since Barack Obama's 2008 presidential run, was talking to a friend, Jimmy Dahman, another campaign veteran, about the lack of easily accessible information for people who want to meet their members of Congress. So, with a handful of other volunteers, they started compiling schedules of congressional town halls, both in-person meetings and over the phone, and shared it through a Google document in late January, updating the spreadsheet with new information as they got it. But Williams couldn't have imagined the overwhelming demand for such a simple database. He said he thought he and a few others would spend several hours a week on their Town Hall Project. Instead it has morphed into a full-time job, with an army of 100 volunteers fanned out across the country each assigned to monitor the goings-on in several congressional districts. Reminiscent of the 2009 town halls where the newly formed tea party flooded meetings over the impending health-care bill, this year's congressional town halls - particularly Republican ones - are already seeing similar levels of furor over what is happening in Washington under President Trump. By early February, Williams's Google document was being shared all over social media, including from celebrities like Lin-Manuel Miranda: You get nothing if you wait for it... https://t.co/LQT3FtMkuI - Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) February 1, 2017 An image of the Town Hall Project's website. In advance of the Presidents' Day congressional recess, a time when members of Congress typically return to their districts and invite feedback from their constituents, the Town Hall Project has matured from an overloaded online document to a more sophisticated, searchable website. \"In my life, I could not have persuaded some of these people to make a phone call or knock on a door for any reason who are now calling me up and saying, 'I need to do something, what should I do?' \" Williams said. \"There is nobody inspiring this, or leading this, it's coming from the ground level in an amazing organic way.\" Every two years, Williams, who lives in Portland, Ore., would join up with a campaign effort in August or September and work through the election to help get out the vote. After this election, he decided he didn't want his advocacy to be so cyclical. He wanted to work activism into his daily life in big and small ways. For instance, he agreed to teach a workshop at a college in Seattle in March on how to make your activism have effect. He figured the Town Hall Project would be one of those little ways. Williams and his team do not hide their political leanings. They are progressives, who want their voices heard at a time when their side controls none of the power in Washington. But the Town Hall Project is not overtly partisan. There is information about events for members of both parties. The goal is \"the nexis of good government transparency and activism,\" he said. \"Engagement is good for everybody, we're not just targeting one party or another,\" Williams said. \"We want people to go and engage with their representatives, we want people to hold their representatives to the fire.\" Read more Inspired Life stories:  To counter Trump's travel ban, this Jewish filmmaker wants to give American Muslims a voice Why these Philadelphia lawyers are helping immigrants seek a green card for only $1 Why this nearly 100-year-old organization is seeing a resurgence thanks to Trump's election",

            "body": "Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) got a frosty reception in his home state on Feb. 9, at a town hall. Angry constituents packed a high school auditorium, grilled the high-ranking congressman with questions and peppered him with boos and chants while protesters amassed outside. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Rep. Jason Chaffetz's (R-Utah) town hall last week marked a high point for the progressive \"resistance,\" with voters flooding a high school gym, demanding answers on the GOP's agenda, and chanting \"do your job.\" The videos of that town hall swiftly went viral. [Swarming crowds and hostile questions are the new normal at GOP town halls] On Thursday, the Utah Republican Party settled on its response to the town hall drama: Don't let it happen again. In a news release, the party said Indivisible Utah, an affiliate of the grass-roots movement that has grown wildly since the presidential election, \"surrounded a car\" at Chaffetz's town hall, \"denied members of his Congressional District from engaging their Congressman\" and was part of a disruptive national movement. \"This organized mob has displayed hostile, violent, and deliberately disruptive behavior, which is unfair to constituents as it hijacks town hall meetings to prevent any type of meaningful discussion,\" the party said. \"Because of this clear demonstration of violence, if congressional members feel they cannot provide adequate security they should consider tele-town halls to reach out to their constituents instead. If smaller, special interest groups want to meet, they can request meetings with their congressional leaders in controlled environments to minimize the chances of harm until these disruptive behaviors have ended.\" [After angry demonstration in Utah, Chaffetz returns to more wrath in D.C.] According to the Town Hall Project, which collates information about public town halls, there are no availabilities in Utah - where every federal officeholder is a Republican - over the coming week. That's not a fluke. Just 19 Republican members of Congress have scheduled traditional town halls over the week-long recess. Several more, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), have listed ticketed events or \"office hours;\" a few more have announced tele-town halls, which allow constituents to lob questions without risking a \"YouTube moment.\" Since Republicans took control of the House six years ago, helped by angry, viral town halls that embarrassed incumbent Democrats, big public meetings have become rarer and workarounds like the tele-town hall more common. But in the past week, as Indivisible, Organizing for America and other progressive groups have become more open about demanding town halls, some Republicans have become bolder about shutting them down. A few have put their rationales down on paper. In a letter to constituents first shared by the Knoxville News Sentinel, Rep. John J. Duncan Jr. (R-Tenn.) said that he valued being accessible but would not indulge protesters by holding a public event. \"I am not going to hold town hall meetings in this atmosphere, because they would very quickly turn into shouting opportunities for extremists, kooks and radicals,\" Duncan said. \"Also, I do not intend to give more publicity to those on the far left who have so much hatred, anger and frustration in them. I have never seen so many more sore losers as there are today.\" In North Carolina, an activist who asked whether Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) would hold a town hall got a letter attributed to the senator, explaining that it simply wouldn't be worth it. \"As of late, it has become apparent that some individuals who are not really interested in meaningful dialogue attend town halls just to create disruptions and media spectacles,\" Tillis wrote in the letter, which was shared with The Washington Post. \"This is particularly unfortunate because it leads to a scenario in which only the loudest voices in the room can be heard and very little meaningful discussion can actually occur. While I am certain you have no interest in being a part of such a session, clearly some folks have intentions that are not as pure as yours.\" Republicans have gotten crucial support for this position from conservative media and from the campaign organizations tasked with keeping their majority. In a memo to reporters, largely consisting of a CNN story about how a constellation of progressive groups were organizing town halls, the National Republican Congressional Committee denounced a \"top-down effort\" to manufacture controversy. \"Fox and Friends,\" a cable news morning show that President Trump watches regularly (and praised in Thursday's news conference), has frequently highlighted violent protests and hyped reports that some protesters are being paid. \"George Soros is manipulating protests behind the scenes,\" Bill O'Reilly told Fox News viewers last month. This week, the NRCC shared a story that would be cited by Utah's GOP - a protest at the office of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) in which a 71-year-old staffer, Kathleen Staunton, was injured. According to CBS Los Angeles, \"Staunton was trying to exit through the front door of Rohrabacher's office to visit a restroom when, according to Rohrabacher, a protester yanked the door open, causing her to fall and hit her head.\" No charges were filed, but in a statement, both Rohrabacher and the NRCC suggested that the incident revealed the true, dangerous nature of Indivisible. \"Deliberate or not, the incident came as part of a mob action that not only intimidates but coerces,\" Rohrabacher said. \"Though the protesters think of themselves as idealists, they engaged in political thuggery, pure and simple.\" \"Concerned citizens, huh?\" wrote NRCC western regional spokesman Jack Pandol, sharing the story with reporters. And in Florida's conservative first district, the rumors of violence at town halls inspired a local activist, as well as members of Bikers for Trump, to encourage armed supporters of Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) to \"protect\" him. (Bikers for Trump also appeared at inaugural week events in Washington, with no incidents.) \"I need all patriots in attendance to protect Congressman Gaetz from any potential disruption of his speech,\" Geoff Ross wrote on Facebook, as first reported by the Huffington Post. \"Concealed carry permit holders most welcome - don't forget your ammo.\" As it's become clear that few members of Congress would hold town halls, Indivisible has designed contingency plans. On Thursday night it held a call for activists and shared its Missing Members of Congress Action Plan, with ideas like posting \"Missing\" signs in the district, and holding \"empty chair\" town halls. Several empty chair events are planned for this week, including one targeting Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and one targeting Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.). But progressive activists aren't alone in their frustration. Americans for Prosperity, the grass-roots conservative group co-founded by David Koch, has promised to hold Republicans accountable - in public - if they do not fully repeal the Affordable Care Act. Heritage Action, the grass-roots political arm of the Heritage Foundation, has done the same, and compiled a partial list of public town halls for activists. Just a few Republicans made that list, and the Republicans sounding most confident about the upcoming recess generally are ready to break with the party's leadership. Thursday night, at a roundtable at the Newseum sponsored by BuzzFeed, House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said that he would be holding a public meeting in his district and knew full well that progressive activists would find it. \"God bless 'em for coming out,\" said Jordan.

And they may be right about that. All the while their inner rot grows &amp; grows until they crumble off like part of a dead tumor.",
                "Well, they know that, like in Utah (where I live) voters have a short attention span.  The elected official may really really tick off their constituents, but a year, two later, they get voted right back in.  And part of that is Utah's vote party system.  \n\nFor instance, there was a mayor in a local city that was deeply unpopular.  But he kept getting re-elected.  Nobody \"could figure out why.\"  Well, I knew, but I kept my mouth shut.  Couldn't though, one day when I was in line at the grocery store.  Two women were complaining about the mayor and I finally said, do you vote straight party Republican?  They looked at me, and I repeated myself and they finally said yes.  And I said, congratulations, you keep re-electing him.  Apparently they were unaware that when you vote straight party, you vote the entire party, and that going back and changing a vote doesn't work.  And that pretty much covers everything here.  People are too lazy to vote single candidate, hit vote straight party Republican and everyone gets re-elected.  \n\nAnd that pretty much goes for the entire country.  Until people wise up and stop voting blindly, why should these Republicans care?  They know that they'll get re-elected, no matter how popular, or unpopular, they are.",

With the healthcare bill in 2009 and the Tea Party, communication about the benefits of the bill was the problem. With the town halls now, the issue is that the GOP has thoroughly exposed itself as corrupt and rotting from the inside, and people are mad, and rightly so. I'm not saying violence is a good thing, but if safety is a concern at a politician's town hall, that's a sign that there's a big problem that the politician needs to deal with.

            "body": "House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) talks to the media on Thursday at the Capitol in Washington. (Jim Lo Scalzo/European Pressphoto Agency) House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) outlined a health-care plan to his members yesterday. Surprisingly, it did not include much detail, either because the speaker has not gotten that far or because he's afraid of the reaction when the numbers are revealed. The basic outline comes from his \"A Better Way\" health-care plan. The Associated Press reports:  It features a revamped Medicaid program for the poor, tax breaks to help people pay doctors' bills and federally subsidized state pools to assist those with costly medical conditions in buying insurance. Lawmakers called the ideas options, and many were controversial. One being pushed by Ryan and other leaders would replace the tax increases in Obama's law with new levies on the value of some employer-provided health plans - a political no-fly zone for Republicans averse to tax boosts. \"You have to legislate with a sense of political reality,\" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who said backing that proposal \"would set up an ad against you from multiple directions\" during upcoming elections. In lieu of an individual mandate and subsidies to buy insurance from the exchanges (according to a sliding scale by income), the GOP plan gives rich and poor alike a tax credit, which would be adjusted by age. It's not yet clear the amount of the credit or what it would buy (a catastrophic plan?). The absence of dollar amounts is striking. Unless the amount of the credit is linked to the cost of coverage comparable with what people received under the Affordable Care Act (and subject to indexing), it will represent a reduction in coverage (or higher costs if people want to \"buy up\"). If people will be reduced to buying catastrophic coverage, their deductibles may be larger, not smaller than they were under Obamacare policies. That's a step backward for many Americans, who complain that the deductibles are too high already. Moreover, depending on the differential between the credit for older and younger Americans, older people (who use more health care) may wind up paying more. These also happen to be the most regular voters. Equally problematic is the use of health-care saving accounts in lieu of the subsidies available on the Obamacare exchanges. If working-class people do not have the extra income to contribute (albeit on a pre-tax basis), once again they will be worse off than they were previously. Democrats will also see this as cost-shifting from rich to poor since the rich in higher income brackets get a bigger benefit from pre-tax dollars than do people in a lower income bracket. Ryan's solution to preexisting conditions is to dole out grants to states to maintain high-risk pools. But what if the amounts are not enough to cover these people? The most controversial element may be in the Medicaid arena. \"According to documents distributed to members and obtained by The Associated Press, the expansion of Medicaid to millions of additional poorer people - almost entirely financed by federal taxpayers - would be phased out. In a compromise aimed at resolving a bitter dispute, extra Medicaid money would flow to the 31 states that accepted that expansion and the 19 that didn't, though it would end 'after a certain date' left unspecified.\" How are states to continue covering people - or are they expected to kick poor people off the Medicaid rolls? For Medicaid, Ryan envisions moving to either a block grant or per-capita cap. In essence, Medicaid would go from a defined benefit to a defined contribution plan. Without numbers, it is hard to see whether those getting benefits now will be cut off or have higher out-of-pocket costs. When you look at this on paper, the central question remains: From the point of view of the consumer, how is the GOP plan better? We know the problems with Obamacare, but Republicans have been claiming that their plan will be more flexible, more generous and cheaper while also offering higher-quality care. Based on the scant details we know so far, this does not come close - for a very good reason. Without massive new taxes to pay for it, it's hard to deliver more coverage for less. In other words, Republicans promised more and are delivering arguably less than Obamacare does. No consensus exists for this plan - or any other plan. And when President Trump figures out that the GOP plan may adversely affect his strongest supporters (older, working-class voters), he may well turn around and attack his party. (No wonder many House members are paralyzed.) Moreover, even if Republicans can agree among themselves, it's hard to come up with the names of eight Democrats who would go along with their plan. Meanwhile, the task of cost containment still looms. Republicans hope that allowing insurance sales across state lines and use of health-care savings accounts will help rebuild the insurance market, increase competition and thereby lower costs. That's the theory, but no one really knows how effective that will be. Moreover, even if coverage costs come down over time, ordinary Americans may be footing higher medical bills in the short term. This is not an argument for the ACA or against reform. We simply point out the gap between what Republicans have been promising and what they are willing to deliver. That gap, the unfavorable comparison with Obamacare benefits and the lack of a funding mechanism do not bode well for a \"repeal and replace\" plan. You do wonder when Republicans will come around to a piecemeal approach. Try to fix rural health care in one bill, for example. Perhaps attempt to rejigger the requirement that insurance companies spend at least 80 percent of the money they take in from premiums on actual health care so as to try to induce them back into the market. Instead of high-risk pools, allow states to experiment, as Alaska did successfully, with reinsurance systems. In addition, it might be necessary to leave those Obamacare taxes in place to pay for all this. These might work, but, of course, it would not constitute a \"repeal\" of Obamacare in any sense of the word. Such reforms will not be \"big\" enough for many Republicans or for Trump, who promised the sun and the moon and remain hemmed in by their no-tax-hikes-anytime doctrine. No doubt Democrats would respond to their colleagues by saying: It's your own darn fault. They have a point.",

One of the issues with Obamacare has been that it takes insurance companies several years to figure out how to appropriately price their products - and failure to do so effectively has driven many insurers out of markets. There is nothing about selling across state lines that changes that. In fact, if any insurance companies do sell cross-state plans, and different states are allowed to sell plans with different requirements, it could just end up confusing consumers. ObamaCare requires insurance to cover quite a few things that weren't required in every state in the pre-ACA days. If we go back to that, consumers may need to learn the requirements of several states before they buy. Otherwise, they'll end up with cheap insurance that doesn't cover hospital visits.",

                "Paul Ryan is selling yet another GOP scam. The clue is \"tax cuts.\" Less than 35% of US households could pay more than a fraction of their health insurance costs with tax cuts.  \n \n50% of households make under $54k a year and literally have zero\" income tax\" from which they could use a tax cut. They pay FICA Payroll tax, but that is never mentioned by the GOP.  \n\n<strong>FICA is not income tax. </strong> The vast majority of people who watch FauxNoise, listen to Limbaugh and read Breitbart don't know that. I dare reporters to get Paul Ryan in front of a camera and try to get him to state that directly.\n \nHouseholds up to $80k a year start paying some income tax but a typical household needs $125-150k a year before the GOP tax break plan makes a 25% dent in the $15-30k annual premium per household. \n \nPaul Ryan is a fiscal fraud.

When the claims pile up then the company files for bankruptcy leaving a huge pile of unpaid bills.\n\nThen there is the claims process. How will a policy holder settle rejected claims. Will the law force the insurance company to have offices in the state and use policy holder state courts or will the policy holder have to go to a far away states such as Idaho to resolve Florida claims.\n\nThe reality is insurance companies need state presence to put together provider networks of doctors and hospitals.

Bickering between the United States and Iran over President Trump's controversial executive order concerning immigrant and refugee travel nearly sank their trip to the highly anticipated World Cup freestyle championship. They were in, out and then in again. But the U.S. wrestlers finally made it to Kermanshah, Iran, and they reached Friday's gold medal match. This time, as far as the top spot on the podium was concerned, they were out, in and then out again, as their dramatic comeback fell just short. The United States settled for second place, as the host nation posted a 5-3 victory to claim gold. The Americans dropped their first four matches of the tournament's final, before Olympic champions Jordan Burroughs and Kyle Snyder helped mount a comeback. The U.S. team trailed 4-3 entering the day's winner-take-all final match, in which Nick Gwiazdowski was foiled by Iran's Komeil Ghasemi, 5-0. [U.S. wrestlers in Iran welcomed with roses and selfies] Just reaching Kermanshah felt like an accomplishment of sorts in the wake of the political posturing that had jeopardized the trip earlier this month. After Trump issued his order on travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iran, the Americans were initially assured that they would be allowed to enter the country. But the Iranian government reversed course and announced the U.S. team would not receive visas. Then, after a federal judge suspended Trump's order, Iran decided to allow the American squad to enter the country after all. 1 of 44 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Rio 2016 Olympics: Day 16 View Photos Here are some of the best photos of the day.

Smith/EPA Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Political backdrops aside, Friday's final still presented an intriguing matchup. The two nations also had squared off in last year's World Cup, where they split four matches but Iran claimed gold with a narrow win on criteria, 17-15. The Iranians cruised through the early rounds of this year's tournament, winning 23 of their 24 bouts in the three matches leading into Friday's final. The U.S. squad, meanwhile, advanced to the finals by beating Azerbaijan, 20-14, on criteria after splitting, 4-4. On Friday, the Americans struggled to get on the scoreboard, letting Iran race out to its 4-0 lead. Nothing was going right. In the 65-kilogram match, Frank Molinari had jumped up 4-0 on Iran's Meisam Nasiri but ultimately lost, 5-4; it looked as if it was that kind of day. Iran needed just one more win to secure gold. But Burroughs outpointed Peyman Yarahmadi, 3-2, and then David Taylor scored a second-round pin over Hassan Yazdanicharati to close the overall gap to 4-2. Burroughs and Taylor were the only Americans to go undefeated on the week. [Brewer: The agony of Jordan Burroughs's Olympic defeat] At 97 kilograms, Snyder, the 2016 Olympic champ who hails from Woodbine, Md., topped Amir Mohammadi by a 6-0 count and brought the U.S. team to within one with just one match remaining. That brought Gwiazdowski to the mat to face Ghasemi, who won silver at the Rio Olympics last year. The stakes couldn't have been higher: The winner of the tournament's final match would take gold. Ghasemi's high-crotch takedown allowed him to take a 3-0 lead after the first period. Gwiazdowski was unable to battle back, losing on points. While the travel drama between the two counties is likely to continue - Trump has promised to issue a revised executive order addressing the matter soon - the World Cup participants hailed the week's tournament as a politics- and drama-free showcase of wrestling at its highest level. \"More than ever before wrestling has proven it is capable of bringing people and nations together,\" Nenad Lalovic, president of United World Wrestling, the sport's international governing body, said in a statement Thursday.",

            "body": "(Illustration by Jasu Hu for The Washington Post) In the fall of 2007, Steven Fabre appeared in my courtroom. He was a 29-year-old New York native there to plead guilty to a single count of possession with intent to distribute crack. Fabre was a typical street dealer who found business by approaching cars or pedestrians. He used the proceeds from his sales to feed his own addiction; he'd been using drugs since he was 14. Fabre had a number of convictions for very minor offenses, plus one for selling a small quantity of a controlled substance, for which he received five years of probation when he was 18. He never graduated from high school and had worked only for a short time, stocking his parents' small grocery store. Fabre's life was troubled, but he was not a leader, a manager or an organizer of drug sales. Nor was he the source of any of the drugs he peddled - in fact, he didn't even know how his supplier got them. This time, though, he'd sold more than five grams of crack, which meant he faced a mandatory five-year sentence. With no choice in the matter, that is the sentence I imposed. Prison destroyed his relationship with his girlfriend and separated him from his infant daughter. It exposed him to far more sophisticated criminals than he knew on the street. Most important, it is doubtful that prison provided much in the way of treating his drug addiction, which I viewed as the real source of his problems. I would never have imposed that sentence if I hadn't been forced to. Our laws failed Steven Fabre. In my nearly 22 years as a U.S. district judge in New York, I sentenced roughly 1,000 defendants. Thankfully, not all were subject to \"mandatory minimum\" sentences - in which Congress has imposed a required statutory punishment for a particular crime. But many were; 145 federal crimes still require a minimum sentence, including distribution of narcotics, immigration violations and identity theft, just to name a few. Every first-year law student learns that sentencing has four goals: retribution, incapacitation, deterrence and rehabilitation. Yet thanks mostly to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, I was often prohibited from assessing a defendant's history, personal characteristics or role in the offense. In sentencing, where judgment should matter most, I could not exercise my judgment. I felt more like a computer than a judge. And I was not alone. Over the years, many of my colleagues on the federal bench felt the same frustrations. This problem upset me as soon as I was appointed in 1994. Mandatory minimums were almost always excessive, and they made me feel unethical, even dirty. After seven years, my patience had run thin and my conscience was troubled; I began to consider resigning. I sought the advice of a revered mentor, a federal judge with more than 30 years of experience. He pointed out that quitting would serve nobody, as another judge would be required to impose identical sentences anyway. He also said that if I left, the bench would lose a judge who could advocate for criminal justice reform through her decisions. So I remained. But to this day, I am pained by many of the sentences I was required by law to impose. While I bore the title \"Honorable Judge,\" I felt less than honorable and more like a complicit tool of an unjust system. (Photo by Jesse Dittmar for The Washington Post) The fact that the United States, with less than 5 percent of the world's population, incarcerates 25 percent of the world's prisoners is largely due to mandatory minimum sentences. Beginning in the 1970s, ostensibly to fight the war on drugs, Congress and many states passed legislation (like New York's infamous Rockefeller laws, adopted in 1973) requiring judges to impose harsh minimum sentences for drug offenses. While there were once three co-equal branches of government, there were now two, with the judiciary becoming the less equal branch: The legislative branch had eliminated judicial discretion in sentencing, and prosecutors in the executive branch decided when to charge a crime that carried a strict minimum punishment. This regime resulted in a steady rise in the prison population from 338,000 in 1970 to 2.2 million in 2010. Mandatory minimums were not the only limit on a judge's discretion. Before 2005, federal judges were required to follow guidelines developed by the U.S. Sentencing Commission. These rules were intended to eliminate disparities in sentencing that often resulted from the unconscious biases of judges. As early as the 1970s, federal trial judges - including Marvin Frankel, the intellectual father of the Sentencing Commission - noted that judges tended to impose lighter sentences on defendants who looked like them and harsher sentences on those who did not: minorities, undocumented immigrants and drug addicts who appeared in court looking poor and ragged. Unfortunately, the new rules codified some of these disparities: At one time, defendants received five years in prison for possessing five grams of crack, while it took 500 grams of powder cocaine to warrant the same sentence. This 100-to-1 asymmetry was reduced to 20-to-1 in 2010. The guidelines assign every crime a place on a grid, with one axis for the seriousness of the crime and the other axis for the number and nature of any prior convictions of the defendant. The guidelines permit some adjustments, such as an increase in offense level when the victim of the crime is especially vulnerable, or a decrease in offense level when the defendant accepts responsibility. The grid produces a range of months in prison that a judge previously was, almost without exception, required to impose. Thankfully, in 2005, two decades after the guidelines took effect, the Supreme Court found them unconstitutional; they could be only advisory. This returned discretion to judges - except with respect to mandatory minimum statutes, courtesy of Congress, which are still very much alive. Judicial discretion in sentencing matters. Many judges, including me, routinely sentence below the guidelines, particularly for first-time, nonviolent drug offenders. Indeed, in 2015 only 36.5 percent of all drug offenses nationwide resulted in a guideline-compliant sentences. Between 2005 and May 2016, when I retired from the bench, I sentenced more than 200 defendants convicted of narcotics offenses and imposed a lighter-than-advised sentence more than 80 percent of the time. Had I sentenced at the top of the guidelines' range, these defendants would have served more than a millennium of additional prison time. After I left the bench, Peter Dubrowski - my last law clerk - and I decided that we would review the sentencing protocols for each of those 200 defendants. As I expected, we found strikingly similar storylines. The overwhelming majority of the defendants were indigent. Seventy-two percent had children to support, and many of the defendants were under the age of 25 - barely adults themselves. More than half had not graduated from high school, most had not obtained a GED, and barely 5 percent had attended college. A majority battled alcohol addiction, drug addiction or both, and had begun abusing substances by age 14. Most were unemployed. Most came from single-parent homes, and most had at least one parent who was, or had been, incarcerated. These common characteristics suggested that the defendants needed a brand of justice that would allow them to get their lives back on track, rather than deprive them of future jobs, roles supporting their families and chances to become productive in their communities. The right punishments would have given them a chance to achieve those goals. But many of the defendants in my courtroom were charged with crimes requiring a mandatory minimum sentence. As with Fabre, there was nothing I could do other than impose the required term. When a minimum sentence was not required, I often sentenced gently. Fifty-two-year-old Raul Martinez, for instance, had never been in trouble with the law until he was convicted of conspiracy to distribute and possession with the intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine. Martinez had been an alcoholic and a drug addict for nearly 30 years. Despite that, he had spent nine years as a corrections officer and several more working in his family's garment business. He began selling drugs only after being laid off. The causal connection was clear: He was drug-dependent and needed money, and his son asked him to help in his flourishing drug business. Martinez picked up drugs and money and made small sales to his son's customers. He played only the menial role of a messenger. Of course, this is not an excuse. Martinez broke the law, and punishment was required. But his circumstances called for compassion and understanding. With a second chance, he could help care for his grandchildren when his son went to prison, which may have saved them from the same mistakes he and his son made. Martinez faced a mandatory 10-year sentence. But unlike Fabre, he was a first-time, nonviolent drug offender, which qualified him for a provision known as the \"safety valve,\" releasing him from the fixed sentence. The guidelines still called for between six and seven years in prison, based on the quantity of drugs involved in the offense, but this time I was permitted to consider all of his circumstances. To subtract six years from Martinez's remaining life would have been extremely out of proportion to the crime. I sentenced him to time served - about 12 months in prison. Does the length of the sentence deter people outside the courtroom from committing crimes? This is a popular idea in our country. Over time, I came to believe it is fiction. If this effect was real, my fellow judges and I would have seen narcotics arrests and prosecutions decline over the years. They never did. No young man on the street was ever deterred from criminal activity by the sentence given to a buddy. \"Contrary to deterrence ideology and 'get tough' rhetoric,\" says a report from the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit that studies criminal punishment, the evidence \"fails to support\" deterrence. *          *          *          *          *          * The U.S. Sentencing Commission can be, and has been, part of the solution. During the Clinton administration, Congress and the commissioners created the safety valve. Under President Barack Obama, the commission expanded the safety valve's reach and eased the guidelines for nonviolent drug offenses. These changes were applied retroactively, allowing early release for many defendants. My hope is that President Trump will appoint commissioners who continue this good work and lobby Congress to reduce or eliminate the mandatory minimum sentencing laws. Unfortunately, while this concept was one of the few with bipartisan support in recent years, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has already stated his intentions to be tougher on crime and has long pushed for ever-harsher sentences. His Senate record is no less worrisome: Just last year, Sessions blocked the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act - a popular, bipartisan bill that would have reduced mandatory minimums for nonviolent crimes - from coming to a vote. Of course, sentencing is the last step in the criminal justice process. Judges do not have the power to address the systemic failures that lead men and women to commit crimes. Organizations like the Vera Institute of Justice and the Brennan Center for Justice are at work right now, engaging families and communities to implement programs diverting children from the criminal justice system and working with state and local governments to attack the social problems, centered largely on poverty and race, that drive so many individuals into criminal activity. Elected officials must strengthen public schools (regardless of Zip code); reach out to addicts, rather than abandon them; and partner with low-income communities, rather than ignore them. A society, it is often said, is judged by how it treats its least-fortunate members. Criminal defendants deserve a fairer shake.",

I've witnessed the damage and destruction their activities cause.\n\nMandatory (or standardised) sentencing is not the problem. The absence of adequate rehabilitation is. A judge is one person, with one area of expertise, and normal subjective influences, but many factors play into creating a court appearance. Even with expert advice, judges make too many poor decisions on sentencing.  \n\nSentences should be set, but remission tied to real engagement with effective rehab programmes and education. Early release should be earned, and effective transition supports provided.\n\nEarly intervention to prevent children trapped in dysfunction gravitating towards addiction and crime is the ideal.

                "As you read and consider Judge Scheindlin's remarks, real-life, working models of other approaches are useful to consider.  Let's look at Denmark.\n\n<b>Denmark has 73 prisoners for every 100,000 residents, while the United States has 730. Denmark has a recidivism rate of 27 percent while the United States has one of 52 percent. </b>\n\nGiven these facts, it seems indisputable that Denmark has found a more successful approach at a far lower cost.  The above data comes from an article by Galen Foote published in the JYAN Blog for the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace &amp; World Affairs.  Foote writes, \n\n<i>\"There are two competing theories regarding the way societies should treat criminals. One is the theory of retribution; the idea that criminals must pay for their crimes through punishment that is proportional to their crime. This theory is focused on punishment and less on the factors, including societal ones, that may have lead to the crime. Around the world studies have show that a retributive system creates a divide between prisoners and society, encourages future criminality, and thus the rate of recidivism. \n\nThen there is the theory of rehabilitation, which is the core philosophy of the Danish prison system. It encourages solving the problems that led an individual to crime rather than punishing the crime itself. It works to retrain and reintegrate criminals back into society. \"</i>\n\nClearly, with success as noted above such systems are worth study and full consideration.\n\nhttps://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/posts/the-danish-prison-system",

                "As a follow on to the above follow on :)  one might ask why is it that Denmark has such a low crime rate?  The answer might be that Denmark has one of the narrowest wealth gaps in the world.\n\nIn a brief article by the AP in 2014, Jan Olsen and Malin Rising noted Denmark's strong unemployment safety net with generous benefits, job training, subsidized child care.  They also noted Denmark's generous pension system, fuel subsidies and rent allowances for the elderly along with free health care and free education.  And yes, high taxes.  \n\nThey also note, \n<i>\"Cause and effect would be impossible to prove, but Danes appear more content than people in most other industrialized nations.

New Orleans has been engaged on several fronts to land a center, including pursuit of Brooklyn's Brook Lopez, sources tell @TheVertical. - Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) February 6, 2017 Under Alvin Gentry, the Pelicans' offense has atrophied this season, ranking 28th in points per possession, according to data provided by Synergy Sports. It isn't improving, either. Despite Anthony Davis reassuming his role as one of the most valuable players the league has to offer, New Orleans isn't threatening opponents on the interior. The Pelicans rank 24th in points per possession on post-ups in the half court (0.874) and 25th in around-the-basket looks that exclude post-ups (1.127) - two areas where Okafor could make an immediate impact. Okafor could certainly benefit from Davis's gravity, considering the All-Star spends an alarming chunk of time being walled off by two defenders. This would be a welcome change for Okafor, who takes nearly 85 percent of his shots with a defender within 4 feet. There's value in positioning him in the paint alongside Davis, too; Okafor's producing the 10th most points per contest on post-ups in the league (3.9), scoring more points per possession than players like LaMarcus Aldridge, Joel Embiid and Kevin Love. Where the pairing would benefit Okafor most, however, would be defensively. The 6-foot-11 Okafor's biggest problems stem from his deficiencies as a rim protector. This is largely why Brown has elected to play guys like Ersan Ilyasova, Embiid, Dario Saric and Nerlens Noel ahead of Okafor in the frontcourt rotation. [Want to thrive in the modern NBA? Perfect the pick and roll.] Davis is well on his way to becoming a historically successful defensive piece, and he could slide to either the 4 or 5, depending on where Okafor fits best. Getting more from Okafor at center and allowing Davis room to roam might be the most advantageous scenario though, seeing as The Brow ranks in the 90th percentile in points allowed per possession on jump shots (0.806) and has the length to cover plenty of ground. Portland Trail Blazers Damian Lillard summed up the team's season thus far with some terse honesty Wednesday: \"We're in a tough place.\" Against an aggressive Jazz defense, Portland's starting frontcourt - without Mason Plumlee, who was dealt to Denver earlier this week - croaked out six rebounds while Utah's generated 18. The scoring load required of the backcourt - Lillard and C.J. McCollum - grows heavier by the possession. Lillard and McCollum each see at least 65 touches and 4.4 minutes of ball possession per contest, according to data provided by NBA.com. It's unlikely that Okafor will ever be more than a tertiary option in Terry Stotts's system, but at least he'll be a considerable threat in that role, lining up for 10-foot jumpers or rolling into the paint on pick-and-roll sets. Okafor would likely benefit from playing in Portland's half court-centric offense, one that spends nearly 4 percent fewer possessions in transition than Philadelphia. Transition has never been Okafor's forte, which is perhaps why the back-to-the-basket forward ranks in the seventh percentile this season in transition points per possession (0.739). Dallas Mavericks Sure, Dallas is 25 games out of first place in the Western Conference, but the eye-wincing starting lineup of Deron Williams-Seth Curry-Wesley Matthews-Harrison Barnes-Dirk Nowitzki is only three games back of Portland for the No. 8 seed. Okafor could help put them over the top. Andrew Bogut has spent most of his first season in Dallas on the bench due to injury. When he's removed from the court, the team's rebounding attack is abhorrent. In total, the Mavericks are the worst rebounding team in the league, as defined by metrics including rebounds per contest, offensive and defensive rebounds per contest, contested rebounds and rebound chances. Okafor isn't exactly corralling contested rebounds like a magnet, but at least he'd keep Nowitzki off the low block, where the 38-year-old gets mercilessly pounded every night. The German sharpshooter has long been one of the league's premier marksman - he ranks between the 80th and 100th percentiles in spot-up shooting points and efficiency seemingly every year - but he ranks in the 61st percentile in post-up points per possession this season. When Dallas is in the half court, he dips into the 32nd percentile in the aforementioned metric. It's not just Nowitzki struggling on the interior: Dallas ranks in the bottom half of the league in effective field goal percentage on post-ups. Sliding Okafor into the rotation might free up Nowitzki to toe the perimeter for catch-and-shoot looks, improving the team's spacing and getting its most gifted offensive threat optimal touches.",

            "body": "Christine Baranski returns as Diane Lockhart in \"The Good Fight,\" which will be available through CBS All Access. (Jeff Neira/CBS) One needn't always perk up at the words \"But wait, there's more!\" which is why it might have seemed, only nine months ago, as if we'd had our fill of the fictional Chicago law firms, courtrooms and political squabbles seen in seven seasons of Robert and Michelle King's hit CBS drama \"The Good Wife.\" Even the most faithful watchers were ready to move on. But what do we know? With remarkable turnaround, the Kings and their collaborators have delivered a spinoff drama, \"The Good Fight,\" which, in its first two episodes, proves to be a more-than-worthy successor, with the potential to surpass the original. That's the good news. The bad news (depending on how much you're currently spending on your TV addiction) is that \"The Good Fight\" will only be available through CBS All Access, the network's subscription streaming site that costs $5.99 a month - make that $9.99 if you want it commercial-free. Taking a page from the huckster handbook, the first taste is on the house: CBS will air a slightly edited version of the pilot episode Sunday night to lure you in, and the remaining nine episodes will be released weekly on the pay site. That's a little irksome, especially for those of us already paying for the privilege of watching CBS on cable or satellite. And yet consumers all but asked for this situation, first by demanding a-la-carte options from their cable providers (which never came to pass), and then, as Netflix and others revolutionized the streaming experience, cutting their cords with zeal. CBS is wise to elbow in on this action. So, with that fine print out of the way, let's get back to appraising \"The Good Fight.\" Set a year or so after \"The Good Wife's\" slaptastic finale, we catch up with Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) at the top of her game. Her law firm, Lockhart Gardner, has merged with two other firms, creating a top-heavy mumbo-jumbo of partners. (Their names barely fit on the lobby wall.) Sensing it's a good time to retire and get away from her displeasure at Donald Trump's election win, Diane is shopping for a country villa in France while she works toward a settlement in her last case, representing the city in a police brutality case. Then her world falls apart. A lifelong friend, Henry Rindell (Paul Guilfoyle), a prominent investor who manages Diane's personal fortune, is arrested and accused of running a Bernard Madoff-like Ponzi scheme. Learning that she's broke, Diane blurts out the f-word with the thrilling emotion of a character who is no longer on broadcast TV. (I guess CBS will have to bleep it out during Sunday's airing.) Diane asks for her job back, but she's shown the door by her weaselly partners, including David Lee (Zach Grenier) and Howard Lyman (Jerry Adler). Rose Leslie in \"The Good Fight.\" (Patrick Harbron/CBS) Delroy Lindo \"The Good Fight.\" (Patrick Harbron/CBS) As it happens, Rindell's daughter, Maia (Rose Leslie, who played Ygritte on \"Game of Thrones\"), has been working as a new associate in Diane's firm - thanks to strings Diane had pulled for her. Maia is now also out of a job and bereft at the possibility that her father (and maybe also her mother, played by Bernadette Peters) were part of such a massive crime. The first treat in \"The Good Fight\" is to see how instantly good Leslie is as a rookie lawyer faced with an overwhelming personal crisis. The show could easily be built around her - and it sort of is. Baranski, of course, is a force all her own; fans will enjoy watching Diane pick herself up and start anew. Her rescuer comes in the form of Adrian Boseman (Delroy Lindo), Diane's opposing attorney on the police brutality case and a partner at a law firm that prides itself on its all-black staff. Convincing his colleagues - among them Diane's former employee, Lucca Quinn (Cush Jumbo) - that she would be a strong \"diversity hire,\" Lindo makes Diane a junior partner. Maia also winds up working there on the lowest rung. And before long so does Marissa Gold (Sarah Steele), and, as we get back to the courtroom, a host of familiar judges and attorneys from \"The Good Wife\" universe begin to reappear. Still, the show is by no means a retread. There are shifts in storytelling and core values that are different from \"The Good Wife\" and make judicious use of new freedoms to be a little more risque. Most notable is the way \"The Good Fight\" becomes an intriguing drama about life at a minority-owned law firm, where the money, clients and a sense of justice are not as easily won as they were at Diane's old job. On its broadcast network, CBS may or may not have had the gumption to roll out a new one-hour drama about black lawyers - and that's not exactly what it's done here, either, using the firm more as a backdrop than center stage. It's a subtle but effective use of diversity that continues to elude CBS in its on-air programming - which is all the more reason I wish \"The Good Fight\" was airing for free, where more viewers might catch it, instead of being offered as a fancy accessory. The Good Fight (one hour) premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. on CBS. The remaining nine episodes will become available each Sunday on CBS All Access, a subscription streaming service.",

(HomeVisit) Maryland is No. 1 on a new list ranking the proportion of millionaire households in the country, according to a recent analysis. The study, released Thursday by Phoenix Marketing International of New York, looks at the ratio of millionaire households to total households. Virginia ranked No. 8, and the District followed at No. 9. The top nine states and the District include: 1. Maryland, 7.55 percent. 2. Connecticut, 7.4 percent. 3. New Jersey, 7.39 percent. 4. Hawaii, 7.35 percent. 5. Alaska, 7.15 percent. 6. Massachusetts, 6.98 percent. 7. New Hampshire, 6.82 percent. 8. Virginia, 6.64 percent. 9. Washington, D.C., 6.32 percent. 10. Delaware, 6.28 percent. The findings are based on mid-2016 data and use other sources, including the Survey of Consumer Finance and Nielsen-Claritas data. Phoenix Marketing does marketing work in the financial services, health care and other arenas. The analysis, called the annual \"Phoenix Wealth & Affluent Monitor,\" said there are roughly 6.8 million households in the country that had $1 million or more in \"investable assets\" as of mid-2016, a 4 percent increase from the same time period a year before. Investable assets include both bank accounts and investments, such as stocks, bonds and CDs. The measure does not include real estate or other property holdings. [D.C. ranks as 4th-best place to live in the country, study says] In its findings, the company said that although overall wealth is growing, the \"ratio of millionaires to total U.S. households has remained relatively flat and wealth is more concentrated and shifting geographically,\" according to a company statement. Maryland has held the top spot in this survey since 2011. For the District, it has bounced around, according to the analysis. It ranked No. 9 in 2006 and then dropped to No. 20 at the start of the financial crisis. It has \"bounced back to its pre-recession ranking at No. 9\u2033 this year, the analysis found. [Washington ranks fifth on list of cities with the most mansions] David Thompson, a managing director of the affluent practice at Phoenix Marketing International, said in a statement, \"The trends we've seen over the past 10 years show a deeper and wider wealth divide as families in the near- and emerging affluent segments fall further behind financially.\" Correction: The proportion of millionaire households in Delaware has been corrected.

Comparing state to state, it correlates, surely, with per capital incomes or average wealth. But it is specific. \n\nThese 10 states are not alone in having millionaires, they have marginally more than other states. Nationwide, per the study, 5.37% of US households have $1 million investment portfolios. Mississippi, at the bottom, has 3.94%. It has its millionaire families; they are a smaller share of the state\u2019s population. \n\nHow is Maryland at the top along with its 7 of its East Coast neighbors? The difference isn\u2019t going to be found in inherited wealth of which some exists. It, the difference, is to be found in careers of the sort that pay well and are not volatile. Dual income households of well-educated couples working and saving over decades have opportunities to build wealth. These states provide those careers. People with the educational credentials migrate to them. Phoenix Global Wealth Monitor measures this outcome. \n\nWhen discussing what has happened in the left-behind America which became important during the recent election, when discussing this America averaging a bit more than 4% millionaire families, rather than bring back coal mining or assembly-line factory jobs, the goal could be to bring career jobs to these regions. \n\nhttp://phoenixmi.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Phoenix-GWM-U.S.-2015-Market-Sizing-Update-and-Millionaires-Ranking.pdf",

            "body": "Former Wizards Coach Randy Wittman during a game last season. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) Like Scott Brooks did last year, the man who replaced him as coach of the Wizards, Randy Wittman is enjoying and making the most of his first season out of a job in the NBA in many years. \"I was in the NBA for 33 straight years without a break, so my wife calls this a sabbatical,\" the 57-year-old Wittman told ESPN 980's Kevin Sheehan on Friday, in one of his first extensive interviews since being fired after the Wizards missed the playoffs last season. \"I'm visiting teams. I'm watching other coaches and what they do in practices. It's given me an opportunity to travel around and see it in a different angle than I've seen it up to this point.\" Wittman, who still has a place in the D.C. area, has also gotten around to having hip and knee replacements that he'd put off while coaching. He's spent time watching Minnesota's Tom Thibodeau, Los Angeles's Doc Rivers and Boston's Brad Stevens run practices, and yes, he still keeps up with the team he coached for the last seven seasons, including four-plus years as the head coach. \"Obviously, when I'm in town here, it gives me that opportunity to see them up close,\" Wittman said of the Wizards. \"I think they're one of the best teams playing right now in the league. The streak that they're on is really good. ... They're just shooting the ball so well. Obviously, John [Wall], getting healthy, John likes to play and John doesn't miss many games, but we knew when he missed the last five games of last year when we were fighting to get into the playoffs that he was hurting pretty bad. I think getting himself healthy was huge, because he's gone to another level of play. You can tell in his legs and his spring how that has really helped him.\" [Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal agree: John Wall is the best PG in the East] Wall, who underwent surgery on both knees during the offseason, is enjoying the best season of his career. He is averaging a career-high 22.8 points and 10.6 assists per game and will play in his fourth consecutive all-star game on Sunday in New Orleans. \"John is, I think, he's the best point guard in the league right now, the way he's playing, and that's just not his numbers,\" Wittman said. \"He's seeing things on the floor that nobody else can see, and you can't teach it.\" The Wizards enter the all-star break with a 34-21 record, two games behind Boston for the No. 2 spot in the Eastern Conference and five games behind Cleveland. Wittman said he thinks the Wizards are a legitimate contender in the playoffs and he doesn't expect Washington to make a major move before Thursday's trade deadline. \"I think they match up well with anybody in the East,\" Wittman said. \"Right now, you only have three consistent teams really. Cleveland, and who knows what's going to happen there with [Kevin] Love missing the next six to eight weeks with his knee surgery. Coming back from that, is he going to be the same? That game that they played here, which I think was one of the best games that I've seen this year, and Love was really the difference-maker in that game, I thought, in hitting the three and spreading the floor as he did. Now they don't have him. It'll be interesting to see, is LeBron [James] going to have to play more minutes and get worn down? So, they've matched up decently with them. ... Boston, they match up well against. And Washington, those are the three teams that really I think are head and shoulders above everybody else.\" [Bog Archive: Wizards Twitter will miss Randy Wittman's face] Wittman was 178-199 in Washington and led the Wizards to the second round of the playoffs in 2014 and 2015. Beset by injuries, including to Bradley Beal, the Wizards finished 41-41 last season. Sheehan asked Wittman if he has any regrets about his time in Washington. \"You look back, and that's how you get better,\" Wittman said. \"If you're not, if you're saying you did everything right, you're not going to become a better person, coach, father, it doesn't matter what it is. There's things in life that you learn and you try to improve upon, and I'm doing that. I do that every year. I don't have any regrets of my time here. Listen, when I came here and took over, it was a mess. We were floundering and we were able to right the ship, as I like to say, and get it moving in a good direction. We had a bump in the road last year, I think, and if we would have stayed healthy we could've continued that moving forward. But to get this team where it was when I took over and then to get them back to back to the second round of the playoffs, and again, you look back and from a health standpoint, if John doesn't break his hand and miss those three games against Atlanta, do we get to the Eastern Conference Finals [in 2015]? ... Last year was last year. You sit back, you look, you try to grow from it, and that's what I'm doing.\" In an interview with NBA.com last week, Wittman indicated that he's interested in possibly getting back into coaching. \"I'm in between jobs,\" he said. \"Early spring when things begin to open up, I'll take a look at what's out there and see if I want to get back in it.\"",

Wittman could end up coaching in the NBA again, but I think he would have a hard time serving as head coach for any team that has proven star talent.",

            "body": "Redskins have many options for quarterback Kirk Cousins. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)   Now that the NFL's window for applying the franchise tag is here, opinions are flying about what the Redskins should do with quarterback Kirk Cousins: Keep the quarterback under wraps by using the costly franchise tag for a second consecutive year? Tag him, but ultimately broker a long-term contract? Tag and trade him, to get value for Cousins, whose stock is high, and take their chances with veteran backup Colt McCoy or 23-year-old Nate Sudfeld, a sixth-round pick in 2016, or woo an established free agent. [If the Redskins part ways with Kirk Cousins, here are three QB options] Former NFL coach Steve Mariucci, who was Brett Favre's quarterback coach at Green Bay before being named head coach in San Francisco and, later, Detroit, has a unique way of analyzing the pros and cons. It starts with an eye-popping number: 7.3 billion. And it leads to this conclusion: \"You've got to keep [Cousins], and you're gonna have to pay him and keep your fingers crossed that you can still surround him with enough supporting cast to get it done.\" Here's how Mariucci, now an NFL Network analyst, sized it up in a recent interview. \"There are 7.3 billion people on this planet, last I counted,\" Mariucci said. \"But there are not enough human beings to fill the 32 franchise quarterback spots; they don't exist. So when you have a [Tom] Brady and [Aaron] Rodgers, a Matt Ryan and a [Ben] Roethlisberger - those great, Pro Bowl, franchise kind of guys - you just thank your lucky stars every day.\" Meanwhile, the 28-odd other NFL teams are looking for that caliber-quarterback, and many end up overpaying - awarding $20 million-a-year contracts and up on a hunch. The questions facing the Redskins, five years after their costly trade to draft Robert Griffin III, who seemed a surefire franchise-quarterback, are these: Do they keep Cousins, who'll be 29 when the 2017 regular-season opens? Invest in a younger player? Draft a quarterback and start over? \"Not every rookie quarterback is gonna have success like Dak Prescott did, with a great offensive line and all the things he did so well,\" Mariucci cautions. \"Teams like Houston, they're gonna have to overpay at quarterback and say, 'Maybe this is the guy that takes us there.' There are gonna be some swings and some misses and some successes.\" In the case of the Redskins, Mariucci believes, the smart play is to acknowledge that keeping Cousins is going to be costly - and do it. \"He's a heck of a player,\" says Mariucci, a Michigan native who has followed Cousins's career since the undersized, under-recruited quarterback from Holland (Mich.) Christian signed with Michigan State. \"He wasn't one of those five-star recruits, then. But he is a class act, a great human being and a heck of a leader. Whether you call him an overachiever or not, I think you sign him, and that's your guy.\"",

            "body": "Seth Moulton, (AP Photo/Stephan Savoia) As part of an effort to understand the state of the Democratic Party - both inside and outside Washington - in the wake of Donald Trump's victory, I am embarking on an occasional series of email conversations with people who will be part of what comes next for the party. I began this project by talking to Guy Cecil, a leading Democratic strategist. The second installment was a chat with Jason Kander, a former Missouri secretary of state, who nearly unseated Sen. Roy Blunt (R) in November. The latest is my conversation with Seth Moulton, a Democratic member of Congress from Massachusetts first elected in 2014. Our conversation was conducted via email and is reproduced below. Have a suggestion for a Democrat I should talk to for this series? Email me at chris.cillizza@washpost.com. FIX: Congressman, thanks for doing this. I want to start with the fact that you have been very high profile in your opposition to Donald Trump and his travel ban on refugees and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The Boston Globe wrote a piece headlined \"Seth Moulton is seizing the moment.\" So, walk me through your thinking on why to push so hard - and so publicly - on this one issue. And what's the feedback been - both inside and outside of Congress. I am also interested in your take in whether Democrats need a message beyond \"Trump is bad\" at the moment. Lots of people in the party say \"no,\" pointing out that Republicans made big gains in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections with a message that effectively boiled down to: \"We're not Obama.\" Moulton: Sorry for the delay. My travel has been held up by the winter storm. I'll do my best to answer your subsequent questions more quickly! My reason for standing up on this issue is simple: it's the morally right thing to do. This order is absolutely harmful to our national security - to the safety of Americans here at home, and to the lives of our young troops abroad. Our enemies will use it against us, and our we will lose the trust of our critical Muslim allies. Each of us - myself, my Republican colleagues, and President Trump - swore an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. It's the exact same oath I took when I became a Marine officer. I'll never compromise that oath for the sake of politics, though it seems that the President and many of my Republican colleagues have chosen to do so. In the Marine Corps, you are taught to never leave a man behind. Many of the people affected by this ban are translators who risked their lives by working with us - people who have sacrificed more for our country than many of my colleagues ever will. I won't leave those men and women behind, and our country shouldn't either. And don't think that our future allies aren't watching. Especially in this Internet age, everyone will know how we treat our friends, and that will affect the ability of our troops to do their job as safely and effectively as possible. The response so far has been overwhelmingly positive. That shouldn't be surprising, since most Americans don't support this immoral and unconstitutional ban. But more than any particular policy, Americans are hungry for real leadership. Trump's no leader: He's a coward who's sacrificed almost nothing for this country. And if you look on the Democratic side, our leadership team has remained largely unchanged since the people who just voted in their first election were five years old. It's time for a new generation of leadership, both in politics and in America as a whole. For Democrats, that means stepping up and articulating a clear vision for our future. And I don't just mean more policies - I mean vision. Who are we as a nation? What do we want to become in the next century? What roles can we all have in this new world and the new economy? Trump presented a dark, backward-looking view of America. Democrats have the opportunity to present a vision for the future, an optimistic vision that's true to our values and asks all Americans to be a part of our success. I believe Americans are hungry now - and will be even more hungry after a few years of Trump - for an optimistic vision for the future and a real plan to get there. FIX: Ah, yes, the 'vision' thing. What I am left with after this last campaign, however, is that the vision Donald Trump offered of America - where we are and where we are going - was fundamentally at odds with the vision that politicians of the left and right have offered before. Trump's America was a dangerous and chaotic place that was on the verge of permanently spinning out of control. Only by electing Trump could we avoid that fate. No one thought the public at large would vote for someone with such a dystopian vision for America. And yet, Trump won. My question for you: Does Trump's win fundamentally alter the calculus of the vision that Democrats need to offer the country? Does your party need to do a better job of acknowledging the struggles many people have? The idea that the American Dream is dead or dying? And, if they don't do that, do they run the risk of looking out of touch ala Clinton in 2016? Moulton: The fact that Trump's \"vision\" resonated with anyone at all is a reflection of how little vision was presented by either side during the campaign. Democrats campaigned on the notion that everything was more or less fine, and all we had to do was stay the course. But that totally ignores the fact that this economic recovery, while significant, has been uneven, and a lot of Americans feel left out. I don't think that most people genuinely buy Trump's pessimistic view of America. Most people love this country and still believe in our ability to be a positive force in the world. But if you have one candidate saying we've got big problems and one candidate just saying, \"That guy's nuts!\" you can understand why people would gravitate toward someone who is at least willing to acknowledge the problems real people are facing, even if he can't even begin to offer any realistic solutions. It makes total sense that the generation who's led us here over the last twenty years would say that \"everything is fine\" or that \"they alone can fix it.\" But this election has shown us that people are hungry for change. It's going to take a new generation of leaders to offer the kind of real, sweeping change that people are looking for. I do not believe we should try to \"trump Trump\" with a similarly dark message or similarly pessimistic messengers. One piece of encouraging news is that I've spoken with dozens of service veterans who feel called to run for office in the wake of this disaster - and that's just in the last few weeks. These are Americans who, unlike Trump, have actually made sacrifices for our country. They know that the America they fought for, or the community they served through civilian service programs, is better than the weak country Trump wants us to be. Democrats have a chance to be the party that offers that new generation of leadership to America. I'm working to make sure we seize that chance. FIX: To your point about Democrats offering a \"new generation of leadership to America\": The two leading names to take on Trump in 2020 are Bernie Sanders (age 75) and Elizabeth Warren (age 67). Both will be septuagenarians by the time voters vote in 2020. But wait, there's more! The top three leaders for House Democrats are Nancy Pelosi (76), Steny Hoyer (77) and Jim Clyburn (76). And none of them were seriously challenged for their jobs after watching 80 seats disappear between 2010 and 2016. Doesn't that make it hard to say Democrats to say they are the party where young leaders are most welcome? Why wasn't there a more serious challenge to the Congressional leadership following 2016? And why aren't more young people looking at that 2020 presidential open nomination and stepping forward? Moulton: I've been very clear - and very public - that it's time for a new generation of Democratic leaders to step up, both in Congress and in states across the country. And I think there's far more support for change than the result of [Ohio Rep.] Tim Ryan's leadership challenge, for example, might suggest. The support I've received for pushing for change within our caucus has been far greater than I ever imagined. The reality is that many people understand that we need a change, but too many are afraid to make it happen. Courage, more than anything else, is what's missing from Washington today. And this next generation, the generation that fought in Iraq and Afghanistan and has served in disproportionate numbers here at home, is far better prepared to provide that courageous leadership than the generation that sent us there. You're right that this next generation isn't reflected in our current leadership - yet. But remember also that it's February 2017. Barack Obama wasn't on anyone's presidential radar in February 2005. And he was considered a long shot at best when he announced his candidacy two years later. But he emerged as a national leader because he was willing to speak past the bitter partisanship of the day and articulate a bold, optimistic vision for the future of our country. And he put his reputation on the line to defend that vision when the establishment told him it was too bold or it wasn't his turn. People respected that, were inspired by it, and in the end they elected a 47-year-old as president of the United States. The next generation of Obamas is out there. I hope many of them are Democrats. But more than that, I hope they have the courage to stand up and lead. FIX: Ok. Last question. I want to go back to the Congressional leadership issue. It felt like after the very tough results of the 2010 and 2014 midterms and the disappointing result of 2016 it was time for a change. And yet, as you note, Tim Ryan got slaughtered in his race against Pelosi. And the other top two Democratic leaders weren't even challenged. Sure, some of that is about courage. The courage to put yourself out there. But doesn't part of the blame lie with the current leadership team who continues to insist that all is well and no changes are needed? And what does that say about a party who isn't willing - or doesn't understand - that they need to make space for their next generation of leaders? Moulton: There's no question that our party leadership needs to take responsibility for November's election results. My job description as a Marine infantry officer was a single sentence: \"You are responsible for everything your platoon does or fails to do.\" That's as simple and powerful a definition of leadership as I've ever seen. That's the ethic of leadership we need in public service today. And if our current generation of leaders isn't willing or able to provide it, then it's time for a change. All of this does, I think, come back to courage. It takes courage to admit you've made mistakes and have room to improve. It takes courage to encourage competition and know that you have to earn, and re-earn, your position on merit. And it takes courage to invest in the future knowing that someday that future might mean you're out of a job. But that ethos - constantly improving through healthy competition and constantly investing in our future - is the very definition of progress. That's the heart of what we stand for as Americans, and certainly as Democrats. You can get away with bad leadership for a little while in a top-down party apparatus, or if you're a President who attempts to rule by fear and intimidation because you lack the courage and conviction to act otherwise. But Americans know what real leadership looks like. People want to be proud of their representatives. A new generation of leadership is coming, whether our current leaders like it or not. We'd be wise to embrace that new generation. That's how Democrats, indeed how all of America, will win the 21st century. Thanks for this opportunity, Chris. It's been fun!",

            "body": "LONDON - When the Islamic State advanced in Syria and Iraq in 2014, its fighters looted banks, took over oil fields and kidnapped foreigners, seemingly without facing much resistance. But fortunes have changed, and the caliphate is now in deep financial trouble, according to a new study. Burning oil fields in Iraq from June to September 2016, following anti-Islamic State coalition airstrikes. (NASA MODIS) The report, released by the London-based International Center for the Study of Radicalization (ICSR) and accounting group Ernst & Young, estimates that the group's revenue has fallen by about 50 percent over the past two years from up to $1.9 billion in 2014 to a maximum of $870 million in 2016. \"It is clear that the Islamic State's business model is failing,\" said ICSR director Peter Neumann. \"It used to be the world's richest terror group because it basically was a state. But its biggest strength at that time - the ability to loot and extract money through taxes in newly conquered territories - became its most significant weakness as it suffered battlefield losses.\" The new numbers, based on internal Islamic State documents obtained by the researchers as well as a review of previous analyses, challenge previous estimates of the Islamic State's finances by the U.S.-led coalition against the group, which may have been exaggerated. The study will be presented at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. The fragility of the Islamic State's financing model was already evident in 2014. Back then, looting, confiscations and taxes constituted the most significant revenue source for the jihadist group. As the group's advance began to stall, the overall share of looting among the group's total revenue dropped from 52 percent in 2014 to only 20 percent in 2015. Taxes and oil revenue became more important, but both are inherently risky ways of earning money for militant groups. The coalition led by the United States targeted the group's oil fields in air strikes as more locals fled its territory. As local fighters started to push back Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq in 2016, all revenue sources declined - apart from ransom money paid by governments for kidnapped citizens. The researchers believe that the Islamic State losing control over the densely populated Iraqi city of Mosul would result in a major drop in revenue for the group and in a significant setback for the financing of its battlefield apparatus. The authors also challenge the idea that rich fundamentalists abroad are backing the group. \"Whereas al-Qaeda relied heavily on foreign donors, we have not found any evidence of such foreign support in the case of the Islamic State,\" King's College terrorism researcher John Holland-McCowan said in an interview. \"In fact, internal documents show that the group's leadership instructed foreign donations should not make up more than five percent of the group's overall revenue.\" Two other sources of income for the group also were deemed insignificant: ransom money paid by governments for their kidnapped citizens and the selling of antiquities. The Islamic State's ransacking of archaeological sites has earned lots of international attention, but the ICSR says the Islamic State was mostly not involved in trading looted antiquities but rather earned money through issuing permits for locals to sell them abroad. \"At the beginning, we observed a wave of looted antiquities from Syria and Iraq sold abroad,\" said Stefan Heissner, an anti-fraud specialist with Ernst & Young who co-authored the report. \"The supply of looted antiquities has significantly declined since then, along with Islamic State's occupied territories. Traders are now also more careful about looking into the origins of such items.\" And although the kidnapping of foreigners may have been a huge propaganda boost for the Islamic State, it didn't pay off financially. The U.S. government, for instance, categorically refuses to pay ransom for kidnapped citizens to avoid providing militants with an incentive to take hostages. But the researchers cautioned that an imminent collapse of the Islamic State is unlikely. \"The group remains a threat despite such losses,\" said Rajan Basra, a researcher with the ICSR. \"The financial 'barriers to entry' when it comes to terrorist attacks in Europe is very low.\" \"Attacks in Europe are typically 'self-sufficient' in how they are financed, so IS finances being hit doesn't mean that terrorists in Europe will find it more difficult to fund any attacks,\" he said.

            "body": "Rep. Walter B. Jones (R-N.C.). (Harry Hamburg/AP) A House bill to establish a bipartisan commission to investigate allegations of Russian interference in last year's presidential election has garnered its first Republican supporter. Rep. Walter B. Jones (R-N.C.) co-sponsored the Protecting Our Democracy Act on Thursday, a spokeswoman for Jones confirmed Friday. He joins every member of the House Democratic Caucus in co-sponsoring the bill, which would set up a 12-member panel evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. The bill, introduced by Reps. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) and Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), gives the commission powers to investigate \"any attempts or activities by the Russian government, persons or entities associated with the Russian government, or persons or entities within Russia to use electronic means to influence, interfere with, or sow distrust in elections for public office held in the United States in 2016.\" The spokeswoman for Jones, Allison Tucker, said the congressman had no further comment on why he joined the bill. Jones has previously broken with his party on matters of national security and defense: He was among the very first elected Republicans to turn against the Iraq War and express regret for his vote to authorize military force based on faulty intelligence wielded by President George W. Bush's administration. A pair of Republican senators - Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona - backed a bipartisan probe of Russian interference in the election, but they stopped short of calling for the sort of appointed commission that Swalwell and Cummings have proposed. Republicans in both the House and Senate are now largely supportive of having the intelligence communities in each chamber investigate the matter. But Swalwell, a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said Thursday that he had approached numerous House Republicans about joining the bill. Many, he said, expressed agreement with its aims but said they were wary of supporting the Democratic measure for political reasons. With Jones, \"The dam has cracked,\" Swalwell said. \"This is the first time any of them have done anything on Russia with us. ... The Republicans who have been on the sidelines wanting to get on the field, but a little nervous, they don't have to be the first Republican. There's a Republican on board.\" \"Our hope is, the first one has come, now you don't have to be the first one,\" he continued. \"You can get on board.\" Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, made a similar point Thursday: \"Hopefully this will break open something. We don't know.\" Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report.",

            "body": "Spring arriving early at the Kennedy Center. (George Jiang via Flickr) Area residents might remember this as the winter without a winter. As we inch closer toward actual spring, February - a month known for its big snowstorms - has a chance to conclude with the longest warm spell in recorded history. And the month is likely to rank among the two warmest. A little over halfway through February, the District has already seen record warmth. The two days in a row of 70s earlier this month was, by itself, quite unusual. The prospect of more 60s and possibly even 70s ahead only adds a punctuation mark on February, as well as the nearly snowless winter. [Zooming in on Washington and Baltimore's 'snow hole'] 'Winter' so far The 2016-2017 winter (December-February) temperature to date is an astounding sixth warmest on record, in tallies back to 1872. I say astounding, but it is of course just part of a growing list in recent years. December 2016 was in the top 25 percent warmest for that month. January was 12th warmest. So far, February is running fifth warmest, with eyes on a higher prize. ['Fast-forward spring': America's February warmth is extreme, and it's just getting started] The late February forecast 0z GEFS model temperature forecast for D.C. (Weatherbell.com) Over the next week to 10 days or so, high temperatures should flirt with 60 and above more often than not. Such temperatures are much more typical of April. A few days above 65 or even 70 are possible. Consider average highs are around 50 as we close February. A record long warm streak is possible (Ian Livingston/The Washington Post) We have a chance to put together a historically long streak of days above 60 degrees, starting Saturday. Chances are good we can put up at least a three- or four-day streak of 60 or above, even 65 or above. A streak of five days at or above 60 in February would enter record territory. There is an outside chance we could put up five or six days in a row of 60+, but it will depend on how significantly a \"backdoor cold front\" drifting in from the north early next week impacts temperatures. These kinds of fronts are notorious late winter (and early spring) warmth killers and always bear watching. Cooler air is shown on last night's GFS for later Monday. Notice the wind direction is out of the northeast behind a cold front. A near-record number of days in the 60s and 70s is possible By the time February is over, it's reasonably likely that the number of days in the 60s and 70s will rank among the most on record. D.C. goes into this warm stretch with three days above 60 degrees and two above 70 degrees so far in February. If all goes to plan, the city should add on at least half a dozen more of the 60-degree days, and probably at least one or two of 70 degrees or higher. Nine days in February in the 60s or higher would place this year in the top six on record for that count (No. 1 is 14 in 1976). If we can get to four days in the 70s, it would tie for second most on record (No. 1 is 1976 with seven such days). Warmest February on record? With all these warm days in the pipeline, the average temperature for February is also in the running for warmest on record. February temperatures through the 16th and projections from the 0z 2/17 GEFS for the remainder of the month. (Ian Livingston/The Washington Post) This February ranks as fifth warmest on record month-to-date, and is likely to rise in the rankings. Plugging in the best available model data suggests the monthly average temperature ends up around 46 degrees. That would rank second warmest on record between 1976's top-ranking 46.9 degrees and 1990's 45.2 degrees. If temperatures end up warmer-than-predicted, there's an outside chance 1976's record is broken. February 2017 is destined to cap off what will be remembered as a non-winter, adding to the ever-growing list of bizarre warm periods in recent years.",

                "Not sure why anyone would complain about the weather, I like warm in  February.  Our high here in southern Illinois was 75 yesterday, and I enjoyed every minute of it, and will enjoy every day of warm weather we have in the next week and after between now and the time when spring officially gets here.  As for us needing cold weather to kill the bugs, etc, only a solid freeze for an extended period is likely to kill many bugs, because they just burrow deeper.  What does concern me is that my maple trees are already interpreting all of this warm weather as spring, and beginning to put out leaves.  A really hard cold spell would be really hard on them, especially if the sap starts moving up into the tree which it surely is if leaves are forming, because a deep freeze could cause damage due to the sap freezing.  However, we are already seeing robins, and other birds that usually don't show up for another month, and the geese are already flying north.  Which leads me to believe that we are going to have an early spring.  Heck I even seen mosquitos yesterday.\n\nI am 65 years old, and this may seem like odd weather, and maybe it's not the norm, but I do recall a couple of winters similar to this in the 1960's.  One where I never wore a winter coat all year to school in the late 1960s and another when I was able to play outside all winter as a youngster in the early 1960s.  Do I believe in climate change, or global warming?  I believe the climate goes in cycles, due to reasons far beyond what man can cause and that some years are warmer, and some are colder depending on the flow of the jet stream and other factors.  Because while we are experiencing warmer than normal temperatures this year, other places are experiencing colder than normal temperatures, and next year that might be reversed.  Nature has its own course, and we are just along for the ride.  All I know for sure is that I will enjoy the warmth on my old bones while its here.",

DC has always had opportunities for outsized snow given what we typically get, so there is nothing new there. \n\nI think it can perhaps be argued that we are in a \"golden age\" of big northeast snowstorms of late. And it's likely IMO that some is due to the changing temperatures. Places north in particular have a good deal of warming they can take before not getting snow in the same way becomes a thought. Not as much here. It's probably no surprise that places like NYC have seen a ton of top 10 snowstorms in the past decade.. sometimes it used to actually be \"too cold to snow\" because cold was so overwhelming. Not as common these days. \n\nEven places like the Carolinas and Georgia get big snow every now and then but their normal is little or none. DC may be turning into more of that type of deal in a typical winter. But we are far enough north that during the winters where the pattern is great we can really cash in.  \n\nIf we finish with 1.4 inches of snow this year (less in Baltimore) on top of the two really terrible winters of recent (11-12 and 12-13) it seems a little more than a coincidence... or at least maybe it should be considered as a legitimate option going forward.

            "body": "Salad (Washington Post Food) I've little to add to the commentary on President Trump's news conference Thursday, but I do want to take the opportunity to focus on a particular answer he gave, as it underscores a theme of mine: He only knows how to campaign; he knows not how to govern. [Trump says 'I inherited a mess,' blasts media and detractors at combative ne] He's very, very good at the former; he's clueless on the latter. A similar problem afflicts his Republican caucus, though it is slightly more nuanced. The exchange in question is shocking, or would be if we weren't already inured to the cray-cray. I'm talking about his \"They friends of yours?\" question to the African American reporter April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks when she asked him whether he'd include the Congressional Black Caucus in his plans to help minority communities in urban areas. ['They friends of yours?': Trump asks black reporter to set up meeting with Black Caucus] Understandably, there's a lot of focus on the racism implied by his response to Ryan, his weird ask of her to set up a meeting with the CBC, his fabricated story of how Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) wouldn't meet with him and his misleading claims on how great he did with African American voters in the election (in fact, he got the lowest African American share of any Republican not running against an African American presidential candidate, i.e., Barack Obama). [Cummings: 'No idea why President Trump would make up a story about me like he did today'] But I'd like to focus instead on his \"answer\" to the question: As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign. I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get. And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher. And by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime. We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible - you know, it takes a long time. It's taken a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved, many of them, very badly. But we're going to be working very hard on health and health care, very, very hard on education, and also we're going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime. You go to some of these inner city places and it's so sad when you look at the crime. You have people - and I've seen this, and I've sort of witnessed it - in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day. They're living in hell. We can't let that happen. So, we're going to be very, very strong. That's a great question and - and it's a - it's a very difficult situation because it's been many, many years. It's been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix. We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there. Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and their living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know. There's one Chicago that's incredible, luxurious and all - and safe. There's another Chicago that's worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts. So, we're going to do a lot of work on the inner cities. I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. Okay? Okay, the words \"education,\" \"health\" (and \"health care\") and \"crime\" are in there, along with the campaign references (again, that's his only strong suit) and some amped up fear factor. But this is pure, wilted word salad. There's not one idea, one policy, that might actually help people in places with insufficient opportunities, harmful infrastructure and inadequate housing, education and health care. Unfortunately, there's a logic to that, which brings up my slightly more nuanced point. While Trump knows no policy, his Republican caucus knows one policy very well: tax cuts for the wealthy. And they've got a variety of plans cooked up to deliver the goods to their well-heeled funders, including cuts in the high-end personal tax rates, business tax rates and, in repealing the Affordable Care Act, the upper-income taxes that support health reform. How does this relate to the urban word salad? Once you cut trillions in revenue flowing to the Treasury, you've got to make some show of offsetting the budget deficits you're inflating. They won't touch defense, and while congressional Republicans would love to go after Social Security and Medicare, the president might block them on that. So you must whack everything else, which includes Medicaid (including the Obamacare expansion which has covered millions of low-income people in urban areas), food stamps and all the discretionary programs that support poor and moderate income people, including those in inner cities. I'm talking housing programs, urban infrastructure, training programs, college assistance and more. We've shown that 62 percent of the spending cuts in recent House Republican budgets fall on programs that serve low- and moderate-income families. So, I understand why the president had nothing to say in that answer. But I can't overstate the importance of focusing not only on the outrage but also on the absence of any substantive ideas behind the rhetoric.",

I just get overwhelmed by so much of the crazy contradictions.  \"We are going to work very quickly\"/\"You know it takes a long time.\"  I have trouble even trying to make out what, if any, kind of policy he is proposing,",
                "When Trump makes a preposterous sweeping generalization that cannot stand the light of facts, he \"explains\" it by changing it to something else; and then he berates anyone who attacked the first thing he said which, as said, was false on its very face.\n\nHis cabinet shills, often are the ones who change and restate it.\n\nWhat Trump is providing is material for stand up comedians for years to come.\n\nAs a person who thoroughly enjoyed the \"Get Smart\" comedy series back in the 1960s and '70s, I confirmed that, while more than one great comedy writer contributed to the script, it was Don Adams HIMSELF who introduced some of the best of repeatable situations and phrases, including the \"Would you believe...\" lines.\n\nFor a person who enjoys great standup comedy, Trump is a goldmine of material.  But, more significant than anything else he does to attack his own credibility (he needs no help in that), he will make an enormously absurd, sweeping generalization, horridly obviously false and grandiose on its face, and then attempt to explain it by saying what he claims was the obvious other thing he meant by it, and accusing those who challenged it of being the ones who tried to make out of THAT restatement of it, something it was not... which it obviously WAS.\n\nWhat a marvelous self-stuffed-shirt-puncturing ploy.\n\nIt's not original as a gimmick, though.  Jackie Gleason, Carrol O'Conner and, indeed, Don Adams did variations of it hundreds of times, with the impact getting more hillarious each time.\n\nAll that is needed now is someone to play the role of the true believer that when Trump does this git he is as intelligent as Trump seems to THINK he is.\n\nThat would be a novel twist on it:  a character who worships Trump and is taken in hook, line and sinker by what the stuffed shirt perceives to be universally effective in persuading his stupid audience of, when the audience is increasingly aware of the stuffed shirt's self-puncture.",
                "I'm sorry, but Trump seldom (if ever) uses the word \"urban.\" Instead he talks about the \"inner city\" as a code phrase, to indicate where the Bad Hombres of many ethnicities dwell.  And neither he nor his real estate developments and golf courses will be found, unless it's for a photo op.",
                "How appropriate that he would use the word \"urban\" in any other sense than the \"urban legends\" Trump mistakes for reality.  Thanks for that, shadow.  It would be much funnier, though, if Trump had not offered to declare Martial Law and send in the U. S. Marines to stamp out street crime.\n\nHe seems to view the realities of the inner city as would someone doing a Superman comic, but substituting Trump's Storm Troopers, while Trump, the Superman, sits and directs the quick, easy solution from the White House..",

But this is what we get from Jared:\n\n\"But this is pure, wilted word salad. There\u2019s not one idea, one policy, that might actually help people.\" and \"So, I understand why the president had nothing to say in that answer.\"\n\nSo, you are not writing about Trumps' making of word salads but his looking for policy inside an empty nut shell.",

                "I am beginning to think that the whole point of Trump is that he is going to be on an endless campaign of rallies, press avails, window dressing meetings with foreign leaders. He is not actually going to be running things. He likes reality TV, not governing. He will be a figurehead.\nSomebody else is going to be running things. They are jockeying over that now.\nThe Reagan and Bush II models, taken to the next level.",

            "body": "One of the top high school basketball recruits this season is a 7-foot Bahamian, DeAndre Ayton. He once played for a Bahamas national team, which Nike outfitted. He enrolled last fall at Hillcrest Prep in Phoenix, where Nike dresses the basketball team. In September, he accepted a scholarship from Arizona, where, not coincidentally, Nike outfits the team. In fact, I read a lot about him on a sports news Web page sponsored by, yes, Nike. The brand of basketball shoe - or football cleat - is like a gateway drug for college athletics, influencing where the best players matriculate. A Louisville Courier-Journal story a few years ago found that over half of the top 10 boys' basketball recruits between 2011 and 2014 played for Nike-outfitted youth teams and more than two-thirds of them wound up committing to college teams dressed in Nike gear. All of which underscores a major reason Under Armour founder and CEO Kevin Plank bought a full-page ad in the Baltimore Sun on Wednesday in yet another attempt to mitigate the criticism he received after he voiced his support for President Trump's \"America First\" agenda last week on CNBC. His praise for Trump, who has earned the highest disapproval rating for a new president in Gallup polling history , ignited a #BoycottUnderArmour social media protest and rebuke from Under Armour's superstar endorsers, including ballerina Misty Copeland, action-movie star Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and, most worrisomely for Plank's sports apparel company, NBA MVP Steph Curry. [Under Armour's rocky 2017 continues with lawsuit filed on behalf of shareholders] After all, teenaged ballplayers want to be like their professional idols. That means wearing their kicks. Colleges, which are the best billboards for gear, want to be associated with the cool factor of the hottest brands. And no brand in the past few years heated its image and inflated its bottom line more off that equation than Plank's Under Armour. One of the cogs in Under Armour more than doubling its revenues to become a billion-dollar corporation during the eight years President Obama was in office was its entry into the college athletic uniform market. It began outfitting Maryland, Northwestern, Navy, Texas Tech and a few others. Since then, it has flipped Notre Dame and a number of other well-known schools. The college game got so good to Under Armour the past few years that last May it agreed to pay UCLA a record $280 million over 15 years to dress the Bruins in apparel made by Plank's Baltimore-based manufacturer. \"Every weekend it's on television - every Saturday in football season,\" Sam Poser, an industry analyst, told the Los Angeles Times upon that deal's announcement. \"It's expensive, but those deals really enhance the brand that's doing the deal.\" Offending the lifeblood of that industry could be costly. What major school going forward, save maybe Plank's alma mater of Maryland, where he has invested heavily, would want such an association at whatever remuneration if Curry is uncomfortable with the brand because of Plank's embrace of Trump? What if young basketball and football recruits and their parents - most of whom are people of color like Curry who find so many of the policies and officers Trump is trying to employ to be anathema - start turning away from Under Armour schools and toward schools pinned by Adidas and industry leader Nike? What if some major schools then begin to rethink their association with Under Armour because the coaches of their revenue-generating teams start finding resistance in recruiting youngsters who look up to Curry and decide to imitate his concerns about Plank's embrace of Trump like they do Curry's ankle-breaking dribble? That concern is amplified at a time when athletes, buoyed by the comfort found in the community of social media, are voicing political stances individually and collectively and sometimes acting upon them. The effects in some instances proved damaging to their targets, such as longtime Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who was forced to divest his team after NBA players demanded his ouster following the revelation of bigoted pillow talk with his mistress. Against that backdrop, it was not surprising that Plank's full-page ad didn't mention the new president by name or even by office. Instead, he announced in bold letters, \"We are publicly opposing the travel ban,\" which was Trump's major initiative rejected by people in the streets and judges in the courts for being, in part, contrary to democracy. [Under Armour, Stephen Curry and the risk of celebrity endorsements] While Plank found himself entangled with Trump, Nike debuted an ad campaign called \"Equality\" during the Grammy Awards telecast. In black-and-white footage, it features LeBron James, who famously had his teammates in Miami take a photo in hoodies to protest the killing of Trayvon Martin. It shows Megan Rapinoe, the soccer star who knelt during a playing of the national anthem in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick. It visits Dalilah Muhammad, the Muslim American who in Rio became the first U.S. woman to win Olympic gold in the 400-meter hurdles. And the voiceover is by Michael B. Jordan, who played Oscar Grant in the film \"Fruitvale Station,\" which dramatized the police killing of Grant in the Bay Area. Trump ran for the White House as a law-and-order candidate, the antithesis to the #BlackLivesMatter movement born out of the epidemic of extrajudicial killing of black men such as Martin and Grant. \"On this concrete court. This patch of turf,\" Jordan's voice says. \"Here, you're defined by your actions - not your looks or beliefs. Equality should have no boundaries. . . . Opportunity should not discriminate. The ball should bounce the same for everyone. Worth should outshine color.\" Plank hasn't gone so far as extricating himself from Trump's informal manufacturing advisory board, something Uber CEO Travis Kalanick did from Trump's informal economic advisory board following a torrent of criticism from customers and drivers. But Plank may have to make that his next step. Under Armor stock already was down significantly this year, and Poser downgraded the stock to \"negative,\" citing \"sloppy management commentary in a polarized political environment.\" Kevin B.

            "body": "Jim Harbaugh always laughs last. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) On Monday, the King's Academy in Sunnyvale, Calif., announced football Coach Michael Johnson would be resigning to take a job on Jim Harbaugh's staff at Michigan. But it just so happens that Johnson's son, Michael Jr., is the No. 1-ranked dual-threat quarterback in the high school class of 2019, a coincidence that was not lost on Paul Finebaum, ESPN's in-house Southeastern Conference enthusiast and noted hater of both Harbaugh and Michigan. \"This is wrong,\" Finebaum said Thursday on ESPN (transcription via Football Scoop). \"It may not be illegal by NCAA standards and bylaws as of this moment, but to me, it's cheating. It's blatantly disregarding the spirit of the NCAA rule. We all know why he's doing it. And this is the same person who last year accused Nick Saban of cheating, he accused Hugh Freeze of cheating, and in my mind, and I know you can't prove it and he won't be penalized for it, but he's cheating and why don't we just face up to it? There's no other reason why he would hire this man. It's been done in the past ... but it's still wrong. I don't know why the media celebrates Jim Harbaugh for disregarding the NCAA rule book and doing things that are in my mind unethical.\" Finebaum is taking a rather peculiar stance here. First off, hiring the coach of a hot prospect is nothing new, though the NCAA may soon be enacting a rule that would curb the practice. Secondly: \"it may not be illegal by NCAA standards and bylaws,\" but Harbaugh is \"disregarding the NCAA rule book\"? Not sure that tracks. Thirdly, Johnson has a ton of NCAA coaching experience - most recently as UCLA's offensive coordinator and interim head coach in 2011 - so it's not like he has nothing else to offer besides his son. In any case, Harbaugh took note of Finebaum's comments and on Thursday night got in a pretty good dig by calling him by the wrong name on Twitter. Pete Finebaum, the unabashed SEC water carrier, really needs to get his facts straight. #AlternativeFacts - Coach Harbaugh (@CoachJim4UM) February 17, 2017 But the story took another turn Friday morning, when Sam Webb of Michigan Insider reported that Johnson isn't even headed to Michigan.

            "body": "Lego Batman. (WB/DC 2017) ON ONE QUESTION, Siri was proving as elusive as a Gotham villain. If you've listened carefully in \"The Lego Batman Movie,\" or simply saw the credits roll, you know firsthand that the Apple personal assistant has a featured role in the top box-office film in the land. In an inspired turn, Siri is Lego Batman's voice-activated valet and virtual manservant in the Batcave. But I wanted to know just one thing: How did Siri herself (itself?) come to be cast in \"The Lego Batman Movie\"? Had she had to audition against the personal home assistants from Amazon and Google, let alone the chilly A.I. voices from \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and the Iron Man films? Did Siri know somebody in the animation industry, given Apple founder Steve Jobs's ties to pixilated Hollywood? (Amazon.com founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) How, in other words, did Siri land her first big film credit? The first person I asked, of course, was Siri herself. Because if you say, \"Hey, computer\" - or even \"Hey, 'Puter,\" as Will Arnett says gruffly as Lego Batman - Siri will reply in character. Sort of. [The top 10 Batman actors ever, from George Clooney to Will Arnett] \"Hey, 'Puter?\" I barked in my best Arnett impression. \"Hello, Sir. I've heated up your lobster thermidor in the microwave,\" Siri responded, staying beautifully in character when alluding to Lego Batman's favorite (or at least default) home meal. \"Hey, 'Puter - are you in 'The Lego Batman Movie'?\" I growled back. Siri's cheeky reply: \"There were some long days, but the cast parties were amazing. Gentleman Ghost really knows how to throw down. And Crazy Quilt ... don't get me started.\" When I tried to get beyond that, though, Siri stonewalled me like a bricked iPhone. She would call me Lego Batman, or say, \"I'm quite the virtual voice thespian, if I do say so myself.' \" But Siri just wouldn't sing. Next, I decided to meet Siri's maker. Apple representatives confirmed for Comic Riffs last week that \"The Lego Batman Movie\" represents Siri's feature-film debut. But beyond that, Apple referred me to the movie's studio, Warner Bros. As I waited for days, I kept trying to get Siri to crack under questioning. \"Hey, 'Puter!\" I would begin to grill. But Siri merely back-sassed me: \"You have a message from the Condiment King. It says, 'Pbbbffftttt!' \" - a reference to the little-known Batman villain who shows up in the movie. [The eight best nostalgic Easter eggs in 'The Lego Batman Movie'] Or sometimes her response was a taunting dodge: \"FYI, Robin is trying on costumes in the Batcave again\" or, \"I have your rom-coms queued up, sorted by decade\" - the latter a reference to Lego Batman's repeated viewings of \"Jerry Maguire.\" (Did I mention that Lego Batman is a particularly lonely soul, short of guardian/father figure Alfred, as voiced by Ralph Fiennes?) An image of a iPhone screen with sassy Siri at work. Then, finally, came official word from Warner Bros. Siri's Hollywood debut was the brainchild of \"Lego Batman\" director Chris McKay, guiding his first feature film after Emmy-winning work on \"Robot Chicken.\" But why Siri, I wondered. \"Siri has become an iconic voice in our culture,\" said Dan Lin, producer of the Lego films and the \"Sherlock Holmes\" franchise. \"She talks to more people each day than any of us. \"As one of the most popular computer-generated voices on the planet,\" he continued, \"we thought it felt right to have Lego Batman treat her as though she supports him exclusively.\" That's a great twist, given Lego Batman's loner self-absorption. But why Siri above all other voice assistants? \"She's just got that soothing voice he needs after a tough day of crime-fighting and doesn't crack under pressure during an intense master-building sequence,\" Lin said. \"She gets a lot done, and can be a lot easier to talk to than Alfred.\" Fair enough. But that prompts one last question for Siri: Does she like working with Alfred, whose duties she partially inherits? \"I really have no opinion.\" Thanks, Siri. With safe answers like that, you're sure to go far in Tinseltown. Read more: What 'Lego Batman' can teach Ben Affleck",

            "body": "Dom Fragala spins the ball in his left hand, bounces it with his right, and releases in two-and-a-half seconds. This season, the senior has spent more than 12 minutes in games catching and shooting 303 free throws. By making 265 of those (good for an 87.5 percent clip), the 5-foot-11 guard has cracked the Virginia High School League record books. No player in state history has made more free throws in a single season than Fragala. \"Repetition is key,\" Fragala said. \"It's easy points. Get to the line, do my routine, and it goes in.\" Efficiency at the line has helped Fragala lead the area in scoring at 36.5 points per game this winter, and heading into the 4A West region playoffs Saturday, Fragala is within striking distance of another scoring record set by one of Virginia's basketball legends. Allen Iverson netted 948 points in 30 games while leading Bethel to the AAA state title in 1993. Fragala has 885 points in 24 games. If he continues at his current clip, Fragala would need two region playoff games to eclipse the mark. (Video by Nick Plum for Synthesis/Koubaroulis LLC./The Washington Post) In the open court, Fragala has shredded defenses with his combination of driving into contact and pulling up at full speed for jump shots, including from three-point range. He accounts for 47 percent of the Knights' scoring output. \"You try everything you can to play defense with your hands up, so you don't foul him and make him make tough shots,\" said Freedom-South Riding Coach Justin Powers, whose team allowed 126 points to Fragala in three games against Champe. \"He gets comfortable if you do the same thing over and over, so it's important to mix up your defenses. But no matter what you do, everybody needs to keep an eye on him.\" [His family fled the Taliban in Afghanistan. Now he's one of Virginia's most feared wrestlers.] Unlike Iverson's brash on-court personality, Fragala's success is the product of a quiet confidence earned in early shooting sessions before school. Every morning, he sticks to a breakfast routine of three eggs, peanut-butter toast, and cheerios. When Champe doesn't have a game, he takes an hour of foul shots before school to get his day going. \"I'll see the stats and be like 'oh'. I'll acknowledge it and just worry about the next game,\" Fragala said. \"I'm a pretty quiet guy.\" In mid-December, Fragala followed up a 63-point performance against rival Freedom-South Riding with 52 against Briar Woods. He was 45-50 from the line in those two wins and has led the area in scoring average ever since. After the hot start, teammates naturally wondered if his gaudy numbers were sustainable. As the season wore on, opponents prepared multiple defenses, but no combination of double-teams and presses provided an answer for his scoring touch. \"At the start of the season, we didn't know what to think. We didn't know if Dom scoring 40 a game would work, but then we put our trust in him,\" senior guard Zion Brown said. \"We know his ability to score is the main reason we win.\" Before his junior season, Fragala moved to Champe's district after two years at O'Connell, a private school in Arlington. The move to Loudoun County has allowed Fragala to step out of his comfort zone as a leader. [DeMatha beats Gonzaga in thriller, takes over top spot in WCAC standings] Despite his volume of shots and the attention his highlights have garnered across social media, Fragala's quiet personality has maintained balance in the Knights' locker room. \"He's that silent kind of killer with ice water in the veins. He can shake anything off with a short memory\" coach Bill Maher said. \"If he was more of a loud individual, there may have been a situation, but he's very calm and likeable. Everyone on the team gets a long with him well.\" Last winter, Fragala averaged 18.3 points as a secondary scorer on Champe's first state semifinal team. Playing alongside physical forward Kuony Deng (who now plays basketball at VMI) and point guard Zach Burdick (football for William & Mary), Fragala provided a perimeter threat in a balanced offense. This year, the Knights (14-10) have relied on him to do much more as they return to the region playoffs for the third consecutive season. \"Last year he had more of an equal role as the other two,\" Maher said. \"This year, I did realize that he was going to have a major role, but I was a little bit surprised that he was able to make the adjustment so well.\" [Loudoun basketball notebook: Freedom-South Riding sweeps Champe for Conf. 22 titles] Fragala has surpassed 24 points in all but two games, and poured in 40 or more nine times. In practice, Maher will ask three or four defenders to chase Fragala to prepare for the defensive attention his statistics and game tape warrant. Some teams have implemented a box-and-one (a zone defense where one player is designated to guard Fragala man-to-man), while others fight to deny him any inbound pass and use a straight double team. No matter the defensive strategy, Fragala's quick release has consistently found openings to shoot or draw contact. \"I look to see who's the slowest defender and try to get around him. Once I'm dribbling, the quick release is everything,\" Fragala said. \"I'm always comfortable with my shot, but I have some days where I feel like I can't miss. I just feel it in my body, I can't miss.\" Fragala packed on 10 pounds of muscle in the offseason and increased his stamina. The extra burst has allowed him to shoulder a larger scoring load as a senior, and colleges have taken notice.He received a scholarship offer from Mississippi Valley State in December and has interest from a host of other Division I schools. Before he attacks collegiate defenses, though, Fragala hopes to spend a few more mornings practicing his free throws on the way back to the state semifinals in Richmond. \"When I first heard about the record, I was surprised. I didn't realizing I was doing that,\" Fragala said. \"But at this point I don't care at all. I just want to make it as far as possible.\"",

            "body": "The president spoke to and took questions from reporters at the White House for more than an hour, Feb. 16. Here are key moments from that event. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) President Trump narrowed in on one piece of feedback from his lengthy, weird news conference on Thursday. Thank you for all of the nice statements on the Press Conference yesterday. Rush Limbaugh said one of greatest ever. Fake media not happy! - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 That's not what Rush Limbaugh said. The conservative radio host said that the hour-plus that Trump spent railing against the media was the most \"effective\" news conference he'd seen. Why? \"When I say 'effective,' I'm talking about rallying people who voted for him to stay with him,\" Limbaugh explained. It's likely that the \"nice statements\" Trump said he received came from that same group: people who backed him enthusiastically and were pleased to see him bringing the fight that he'd promised. Polling has repeatedly shown that Trump is doing just fine with that group. At Business Insider, Josh Barro made an important point about that play-to-the-base strategy. \"Trump's presidency,\" Barro wrote, \"lies in the hands of the Trump-curious\" - meaning those who think Trump could do a good job but who are skeptical, such as the voters who weren't in Trump's base but who may have voted for him anyway. Maybe they voted for him because they are Republicans who figured the party would keep him in line. Maybe they voted for him because they hated Hillary Clinton. That group was enough to push Trump past the finish line in the critical states he needed for his electoral college victory. \"With these voters on his side, Trump can wield a fearsome coalition that would help him retain Congress in two years and persuade Republicans and Democrats in Congress to bend to his agenda in the meantime,\" Barro wrote. \"Without them, he is unpopular and ridiculous.\" A two-part question emerges: Who are the Trump-curious, and are their opinions of Trump changing? With our partners at ABC News, The Washington Post polled shortly after the election and asked people whom they voted for. Democrats and Republicans mostly voted for the candidate from their parties. Independents were about split. Most independents, though, tend to lean toward one party. If we break out those leaning independents (the narrower bars below), the remaining independent-independent voters were more heavily supportive of Trump than were independents overall. (Note the outlined box.) But independent voters are a small part of the electoral pie. Trump's base of support was mostly Republican and mostly white. Among those two groups, he received more votes from conservatives and those without college degrees, respectively. There's overlap between the moderate Republicans and the college-educated whites. Forty-four percent of non-college-educated whites described themselves as conservative in our poll; only 28 percent of college-educated whites said the same thing, with 42 percent of that group describing themselves as moderate. Among Trump voters, moderates were more skeptical of Trump's upcoming presidency than were conservatives. When asked how optimistic they were about the next year, moderates were 19 percentage points less likely to say they were very optimistic than were conservatives. Asked how confident they were that Trump would serve effectively, moderates were 20 points less likely to say they were very confident. Gallup tracks presidential approval ratings by ideology. For the first three weeks of Trump's administration, the group that's been most supportive of him is the group that was least supportive of President Barack Obama over his last three weeks: conservative Republicans. Notice that outlined box, though. At the top are moderate Republicans, who are less approving of Trump now than were moderate and conservative Democrats of Obama at the end of his tenure. What's more, their approval of Trump dipped in the third week, as it did among independents. Those approval ratings from independents are remarkable, far lower than they were at the end of Obama's second term. If we look at these ratings relative to the overall approval ratings each week - that is, the rating for conservative Republicans minus the overall approval rating - you can see that Trump performs more poorly with independents relative to his overall approval rating. Approval ratings from independents drove Obama's overall approval rating, thanks to how polarized opinions of him were. Trump's approval ratings are driven heavily by how much support he gets from Republicans. If support from moderate Republicans continues to erode, Trump's approval ratings will sink even further. There's a fascinating footnote to this. Fox News, the most-watched network among Republicans, offered skeptical analysis of Trump's news conference on Friday morning - even on \"Fox and Friends,\" which has been so Trump-friendly that the president praised them by name during the presser. According to a pre-inauguration poll from Suffolk University, 20 percent of those who identified Fox as their most-trusted network described themselves as moderate. If Fox is critical of Trump, what happens to those viewers' opinions of the president? Trump has been in office for less than a month, and the extent of his support matters far more in 2020, when he's up for reelection. But if, over the next year or so, Trump's base of support winnows to just that core that pushed him through the Republican primaries, it will be hard for members of his party to stand with him - and it will be easy for Democrats to target their opponents by tying them to an unpopular president. Trump's base doesn't matter, as Barro notes. It's the people who voted for him reluctantly - heavily moderate Republicans - who will determine what happens next.",

                "With Trump's most recent remarks suggesting that the media are \"the enemy of the people\" it is getting very late for those Republicans who harbor some doubts about Trump to decide whether they owe more loyalty to  the President of their party or to American values.",
                "Hope Bump is right.  It does mirror what I have heard in my area.  The 'base' is with him   BUT the Hillery  haters and the Bernicans are leaving.  Likely will be much clearer within the next two years.  Watch the bi elections.",

He won't be up for re-election in 2018, but it might show just how close Casey, the Democratic Senator will have in terms of a race.",
                "I call bullhockey! \n\nBump's analysis of the election was correct.\nTrump won by GOPs holding their noses and coming home to roost. Comey's last minute charge that NY FBI had found possibly relevant Clinton emails on Wiener's PC was taken by the media and voters to indicate that FBI had found the mythical, non-personal,  State Department relevant emails that Clinton should have turned over but erased instead and then lied about it. This was critical for the last few white, educated, middle class, suburban votes, especially women, in the swing states that put Trump over the top. When it turned out in the last couple of days that when Comey made the claim of possibly relevant emails neither he nor anyone in the FBI had actually seen the emails and when they did they were either personal or emails they had already vetted, it was too late to undo the damage. \n\nBut while I certainly hope that when these voters see how deranged and ignorant and lazy and incompetent PRESIDENT (hurts to read that, doesn't it) Trump really is, they will have extreme buyer's remorse. But I call bullhockey on Bump because they have given Trump the power. Once he has the power, their remorse and disaffection does not matter. The presidency is not a popularity contest. Trump controls both houses of congress and the Supreme Court, He rules without constraint. And there is NOTHING the public can do about it, NOW. As Saturday Night Live Spicey would say -- \"That's on you!\"",
                "I doubt Trump will stay in office 4 years. If he does, I really doubt he'll be re-elected. (Pence would have a better chance. So the GOP will try to dump Trump.) If I were a Democrat, I'd do what I could to KEEP Trump in power. If the Dems stop the \"political-correctness\" and the \"fawning\" on blacks and other minorities, they'll increase their House seats in 2018 and win the Presidency in 2020. But are the Dems \"tough-minded\" enough to do that?",

Witness the folks this morning claiming that Trump's press conference was brilliant, that he knocked it out of the park, etc. Witness the same folks ready to blame the media, wicked Hollywood, anyone who dares to criticize his irrational behavior. Witness the online posters who see him and his family as somehow ideal Christians and thank the Lord for his election....you are simply not going to argue with these people. What I have noticed is little comment  from more rational folks who saw his weaknesses but voted for him anyway, thinking, I guess, Hillary would be worse, that he would become more \"Presidential\", that \"what the hell, it's only four years\", etc. etc. They made a flying leap to ignore his total unfitness for office, and admitting they were wrong is difficult for them. It is not as if he is behaving any differently than he did during the campaign.",
                "I agree.  The respective \"base\" voters on both sides aren't likely to change much.  The sweet spot is the center: moderate Dems, Repubs and Independents.  They'll be the ones who sway the next election one way or the other.",

He hasn't changed at all; he is doing all of the things that he promised and he is behaving the way he always has.

Labor Sec. Nominee Andrew Puzder withdrawn due to hiring illegal immigrants as housekeepers. NSA Flynn resignation for illegal communication with the Russians.

Of course this will result in higher consumer price and faster adoption of automation, which still results in net loss of jobs in the end.",

            "body": "Gregg Popovich has led the Spurs to five NBA championships and emerged as one of President Trump's most prominent critics in professional sports. (Adam Hunger/Associated Press) Gregg Popovich called his old basketball coach from the Air Force Academy in late January and asked what Hank Egan, a friend and mentor of nearly 50 years, was up to. Nothing? Then Popovich had a deal for him. Leave the late January chill of Colorado Springs, hop a plane and spend the week in sunny San Antonio, where Popovich - arguably the NBA's best coach but definitely its most complex figure - coached the Spurs. Airline tickets, a hotel room and two good seats for Egan and his wife at AT&T Center - \"Pop,\" as he's known, would take care of it all. Egan agreed, but because this was Popovich he knew the package wouldn't exactly be free. The 68-year-old Spurs coach isn't just a five-time NBA champion and the architect of a franchise that is a model of consistency. He's also one of the most complex figures in professional sports who has emerged as a forceful and unrelenting critic of President Trump and his administration's more controversial policies. More than just a high-profile sports figure with a megaphone, Popovich - previously best known off the court as a professional grouch - has revealed the inner workings of a curious, nuanced mind with a series of opinions noteworthy for their thoughtfulness. \"I'd just feel better,\" Popovich told reporters the day after Trump's inauguration, \"if someone was in that position that showed the maturity and psychological and emotional level of somebody that was his age. It's dangerous and it doesn't do us any good. \"I hope he does a great job. But there's a difference between respecting the office and the person who occupies it. That respect has to be earned. It's hard to be respectful of someone when we all have kids, and we're watching him be misogynistic and xenophobic and racist and make fun of handicapped people.\" [Popovich: 'Do we have to talk about race? ... Damned right we do.'] More recently, Popovich has criticized Trump's executive order banning immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries, and this past week the coach suggested that the United States in Trump's first month had the feel of a country being \"invaded by another power.\" The NBA, which holds its annual All-Star Game in New Orleans on Sunday, is notable for the willingness of its stars and executives to wade into political and social activism. Within the league, Popovich stands out as a credible voice. \"Sometimes when life moves along,\" he told reporters before a game at Indiana this past week, \"you're presented with situations where you find it necessary to speak because so many people either seem to be afraid to or, more sinister, are unwilling to face things and let things go and worry about their own situations.\" Popovich has never been especially willing to let things go. In fact, debate might truly be his favorite sport. Popovich can be cantankerous in public and a thoughtful conversationalist on a wide array of subjects in private. (Brendan Maloney/USA Today Sports) When Egan's phone rang a few weeks ago, he heard the urgent voice of a man he'd first known as a walk-on player at the Air Force Academy. Back then Popovich, a striking combination of military man and Vietnam-era free spirit, spoke two Eastern European languages, majored in Soviet studies and drove a yellow Corvette. In his mind, he was going to become a real-life James Bond. But when that pursuit lacked the Sean Connery glamour he expected, Popovich returned home to master a complicated and diverse game - and to find his voice in an uncertain world. Now here he is, and eight days after Trump was sworn in, Popovich called his former coach and invited him to San Antonio. Egan might not open his billfold for a week, but he knew Pop was bunched up and in the mood to argue; Egan, a wisecracking centrist from Brooklyn, was a reliable sparring partner. \"He's on a mission to educate me,\" the 79-year-old retired coach said by phone late in his week with Popovich. Egan was sitting in a hotel room then, and a few hours later he and his wife would head to Popovich's house. He knew they'd eat some complicated dish Egan would never remember, and after a while the Spurs coach would bring in a few selections from his 3,000-bottle wine collection. Then at some point, one of them would say something to light the evening's fuse, and with the pump primed with opinions and plenty of good red, away they'd go. A natural curiosity He'd sit in the bleachers after losses, alone and fuming. Popovich was somehow less patient then, and athletics officials at Division III Pomona-Pitzer - two small colleges in Southern California that shared an athletic department - knew their men's basketball coach needed a novel way to blow off steam. So into gym walked Pop's designated arguer, armed with a few conversation starters to get the coach's mind off another bad game. More than 30 years ago, long before Popovich's ornery wit turned NBA sideline interviews into a form of awkward performance art, Steven Koblik's job was to tame a less subtle beast. Popovich put his hand through a blackboard once, threw chalk at players sometimes and once challenged any player to take a swing at him. Popovich talks with San Antonio guard Tony Parker during a 2013 NBA Finals practice. (David Santiago/Associated Press) Koblik, a scholarly type with a collection of doctoral degrees, was the Sagehens' academic adviser; his real job, he says now, was to keep Mount St. Popovich from erupting. The most effective technique was to engage Pop in a debate, a twisted form of relaxation for the coach's restless mind. Sometimes Koblik would bring up the Korean War or the underrated presidency of Dwight Eisenhower; he could challenge Popovich on the political climate in Sweden or Israel. Before long, Popovich could barely remember the latest loss. Koblik saw a young coach with a natural curiosity about the world. Culture fascinated him, differences intrigued him; he could talk books or international affairs or the Reagan White House for hours. Popovich revealed he spoke Russian and Serbian (his immigrant parents' native tongue), though finding much more about him was a challenge. In between the postgame therapy sessions, Popovich explored the two campuses and went looking for new ways to express himself. He joined the schools' fraternity committee and became involved in the campuses' women's commission. A part-time associate professor, Popovich moved his wife and two children into an on-campus dorm, and when his mind wandered, he'd invite friends or players over to argue about basketball or desegregation or the existence of God. If a conversation was stimulating enough, Popovich would approach his tiny wine rack, eight or nine bottles that were the seeds of a vast collection, and let the contents and conversation breathe. \"If he saw something that he thought was inequitable or wrong,\" former Pomona-Pitzer player Tim Dignan says, \"he spoke up for it. He wasn't afraid to speak his mind.\" [Popovich: 'Some days, I feel like we've been invaded.'] Other times, as many others discovered, the man just liked to argue - and those who became his friends had that in common with him. Popovich would go on about the complex flavors of some California grape, and just to watch Popovich approach critical mass, Koblik would praise the finest vintages of Coors Light. Popovich was always trying to prove something, on and off the basketball floor. He'd join pickup games with his players, never above throwing an elbow or a fist to create an opening. \"Man,\" former Sagehens co-captain Dan Dargan said recently, \"you never wanted to guard him.\" He was always looking for the little advantages, a hallmark later of his coaching career, and he discovered that his professorship allowed for a one-year sabbatical. He spent it as a volunteer assistant at the University of Kansas, one of college basketball's most prestigious programs. During that year, Popovich was such an eager volunteer assistant, such a tireless learner, so determined to be heard and noticed that legendary coach Larry Brown would indeed remember him and, in 1988, offer him a job with the Spurs. It was a startling career jump from basketball's low rungs to its mountaintop, even for a talented coach. Other than two seasons as an assistant coach with the Golden State Warriors in the early 1990s, Popovich has been in San Antonio since. He'd still call Koblik sometimes, especially when he craved a rollicking debate, but over time Popovich learned to blend his interests: basketball with politics or history or an old-fashioned argument. He showed documentaries sometimes during film sessions, arranged field trips to historic sites, invited guest speakers such as the former Olympian John Carlos, who raised his fist on the medal stand in 1968, to share remarks with his team. Popovich is often a man of few words when talking to reporters, particularly when asked about himself. (Alan Diaz/Asssociated Press) Popovich became purposely difficult during in-game television interviews whose purpose he never understood. Only Craig Sager, the late Turner Sports reporter whose garish suits and unbreakable charm were the perfect counterweights to Popovich's impatient snarl, seemed to draw personality out of Popovich. \"I was always waiting for the next big interview,\" said Craig Sager Jr., whose father died in December but who still answers his phone occasionally to hear Popovich's voice. \"I would almost keep score: One for Popovich, zero for Sager tonight.\" Sager was a worthy opponent, and that's all Popovich ever wanted. \"He just wants to argue. He wants to debate. He wants what he calls a participatory environment,\" said Danny Ferry, who played for and later worked with Popovich in San Antonio. \"He does periodically enjoy mixing up a little dirt.\" Embracing his progressivism For all the conversation starters and debate kindling, there is one topic he refuses to touch: that of Gregg Charles Popovich. In the early 1990s, he was the best man at Larry Brown's wedding, but now Brown cannot remember a single conversation in which Popovich talked about himself. Reggie Minton, still a close friend years after they were assistant coaches at Air Force, learned on long recruiting trips that the best way to keep a conversation going was to avoid asking Pop about Pop. \"He has made some new friends,\" Minton said, \"but he has probably lost some other friends in the process.\" Popovich is famously private, conversational evasion another favorite pastime, and nothing ends conversations or interviews faster than a pivot toward his personal life. The Spurs declined an interview request for this story, and following a news conference before a game in Philadelphia this month, Popovich abruptly ended an interview with The Washington Post after learning that the intended article's subject was Popovich himself. But the truth is, even some of his close friends know only superficial details about him. He prefers cooking shows to ESPN, and he treats the release of the NBA schedule like a holiday because he can comb Zagat for new restaurants to try. Popovich likes avant-garde movies and presidential biographies, and though he earns $11 million per year to coach basketball, he wishes his life were as cool as Anthony Bourdain's. Popovich talks with Tim Ducan during the 2005 NBA Finals. (Lucy Nicholson/Reuters) Culture or politics or the gift of Tim Duncan, the future Hall of Fame center who was the foundation to all five of San Antonio's championships, are ripe topics. But how he grew up? \"We talked about God, we talked about religion, very personal things,\" said Koblik, who has known Popovich for close to 40 years. \"But never about his childhood. That just wasn't part of what we talked about.\" The reasons he left Merrillville, Ind., to enroll at the Air Force Academy determined to play basketball despite not having been recruited? \"We never have discussed that,\" Egan said, \"and I would not want to discuss it with him. . . . You don't ask questions about that stuff.\" The mysterious two years between graduating from the Academy and returning to the school as an assistant coach? \"I thought he was a spook,\" said Dargan, the former Pomona-Pitzer player. \"You go to the Air Force Academy and speak Russian and you disappear for a few years? Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't. Nobody knows.\" Actually, Koblik did pry that much out of him: Popovich spent those two years translating Russian chatter on the border of Turkey, Koblik said. But he was less \"007\" than stenographer, which was boring to him, and so he returned home after fulfilling his active duty requirement. Over the years he embraced his progressivism, the aging hippie who never stopped wanting to fight the power, though for a long time he did so quietly. He made donations to Democratic causes and candidates, but last year he began displaying his leanings more publicly. Popovich has donated to Democratic causes and candidates, but during last year's campaign began displaying his political leanings more publicly. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press) He expressed support for San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who knelt during the national anthem before games last season as a form of protest against police brutality and social injustice. He attended last year's gay pride parade in New York and, during last fall's presidential campaign, openly wondered whether the United States was approaching a tipping point similar to the one that led to the fall of the Roman Empire. \"The question is: Are we in that process and we don't even know it?\" Popovich was quoted as saying in October by the Wall Street Journal. \"I really am starting to think about that. It's not just the two candidates. It's the way the whole thing is being treated.\" [Popovich: 'My big fear is - we are Rome.'] He zeroed in on Trump, saying after he won the election that the result made him feel \"sick to my stomach.\" \"What gets lost in the process are African Americans, and Hispanics, and women, and the gay population - not to mention the eighth-grade developmental stage exhibited by him when he made fun of the handicapped person - I mean, come on. That's what a seventh-grade, eighth-grade bully does. And he was elected president of the United States. \"We would have scolded our kids. We would have had discussions until we were blue in the face trying to get them to understand these things. He is in charge of our country. That's disgusting.\" Popovich, who in 2015 was named the new coach of the U.S. Olympic basketball team, cleared his mind - or solidified his thoughts - by going for long walks or drives, occasionally dialing old friends to ask what they thought about some issue confronting the country. Before he fully made up his mind, he wanted to consider the views of others. They'd talk, and he'd listen or sometimes argue. Every once in a while, if the discussion was good enough, Popovich would ask whether the friend might like to come down to San Antonio, open a few bottles of the good stuff and talk more about it. Interest in other people The day after the dinner at Popovich's house, Egan spent the first Saturday of February watching from the middle of the lower level of AT&T Center. The Spurs dismantled the Denver Nuggets, and Egan found himself admiring the fluidity of San Antonio's offense, the chemistry of its players, the discipline he can trace back to the Academy. But mostly he watched Popovich, who in his 21st season is the longest-tenured head coach in U.S. professional sports, identify with players and coaches who transcend cultures, nations and backgrounds: Tony Parker, a point guard from France; Manu Ginobili, a shooting guard from Argentina; Kawhi Leonard, a small forward from Los Angeles. Four years ago, 10 of San Antonio's players were born outside the United States, the most international roster in NBA history. Popovich's assistant coaches include Becky Hammon, the first woman to be hired full-time as an NBA assistant, and Ettore Messina, a famed EuroLeague coach. The Spurs' roster under Popovich's leadership has transcended its broad mix of cultures, nations and backgrounds. (D. Clarke Evans/NBAE/Getty Images) \"He is genuinely interested in other people, from other places,\" Egan later said of Popovich. \"That might scare some coaches, but Pop looks forward to it.\" Egan said the dinner conversation wound up being milder than he'd imagined. Popovich was in a good mood; maybe his comments about Black History Month, systemic racism and more criticism of Trump - who he blamed for fueling racism by attempting to delegitimize Barack Obama's presidency by questioning his citizenship - helped release the steam. \"It's a celebration of some of the good things that have happened and a reminder that there's a lot more work to do,\" Popovich told reporters in early February, pivoting toward race relations in general. \"But more than anything, I think if people take the time to think about it, I think it is our national sin.\" Egan was in the arena when Popovich made those remarks. The entire experience, he said, made him think back to the early 1970s, when a kid from Indiana arrived at the Air Force Academy and refused to keep quiet. He'd ask questions and test boundaries and argue until Egan told him to go away. He'd do so for a while, but then the team would be on a bus or a plane, headed on a road trip to some new and interesting land, and the kid would slide into the row next to Egan. The coach would roll his eyes but let him talk, about Vietnam or the coaches' game plan or whatever else was on his mind, Egan occasionally entertained but mostly wondering when the day would come that the argumentative kid would grow out of this.",

            "body": "Peter Navarro attends the \"Death By China\" screening at the Quad Cinema in New York City in August. He wrote, produced and directed the film. (Andy Kropa/Getty Images) If President Trump were to make a movie encapsulating his feelings about China, it might look a lot like this: A red, white and blue ball with the word \"jobs\" appears on the screen. It rolls under the portrait of Mao Zedong through an animated Gate of Heavenly Peace, the iconic entrance in Beijing. There, where the ancient Forbidden City should be, belching smokestacks jut skyward. Words then roll against a black background, saying that 57,000 American factories have disappeared since China joined the World Trade Organization and \"began flooding American markets with illegally subsidized exports.\" Next, a bread knife with the words \"Made in China\" is plunged into a map of the United States and animated blood runs out, trickling into the title: \"Death by China.\" The movie actually exists, and it was written, produced and directed by Peter K. Navarro, a 67-year-old professor in the University of California at Irvine's business school who is the head of the new White House National Trade Council. His task: to help rewrite the rules of global trade, from Mexico to China to Britain, and to bring back American manufacturing and jobs. \"The best jobs program is trade reform with China,\" Navarro says in the movie, which is narrated by Martin Sheen, who starred in \"Apocalypse Now\" and as liberal hero President Josiah Bartlet in the TV series \"West Wing.\" Navarro's ideas have been widely criticized by other economists. \"The biggest source of U.S. economic challenges and the biggest set of solutions are to be found in domestic policy,\" said Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama. \"While international issues and a level playing field all matter, China is not the source of every problem, nor is doing something about China the answer to every problem.\" [The places in America most vulnerable to a trade war] But Navarro has struck such a chord with Trump that he could end up playing an outsize role in the administration's economic policy. The president's announcement of his appointment called him \"a visionary economist.\" \"I read one of Peter's books on America's trade problems years ago and was impressed by the clarity of his arguments and thoroughness of his research,\" Trump said in a statement. \"He has presciently documented the harms inflicted by globalism on American workers, and laid out a path forward to restore our middle class.\" National Trade Council adviser Peter Navarro, right, and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, center, wait for President Trump to sign three executive orders on his first Monday in office. (Evan Vucci/AP) Putting nations on notice Few of the people Trump has brought into the White House seem to be so in tune with the president. And for the moment at least, he has filled a policy vacuum by being visible while other Cabinet nominees struggle with confirmation. Navarro has been one of just a handful of White House officials at Trump's side for the signing of executive orders, such as withdrawing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and blocking federal funds for groups that provide abortions or abortion counseling. [One expert's simple explanation of why Trump is wrong on trade] In early February he attended a White House meeting about trade that included Trump and the Hill's \"big four\" - Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and ranking Democrat Ron Wyden (Ore.), House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) and ranking Democrat Richard E. Neal (Mass.). On Feb. 14 and 15, he briefed Senate Finance Committee members. According to people there, Navarro laid out principles - free and fair trade; bilateral deals, not multilateral ones; a reduced trade deficit; a strengthened defense industrial base; and automatic triggers for renegotiation when trade deficits occur. Although he didn't describe any mechanisms, Navarro also listed about a dozen more specific trade goals, including boosting the number of U.S. parts in imported finished goods; developing tools to punish currency ma-nipu-la-tion; cracking down on intellectual property theft that Navarro said cost $300 billion a year and \"steals the seeds of innovation for the future\"; and restricting heavily subsidized, state-owned -enterprises. He also said that World Trade Organization decisions had been \"unfair\" to the United States and that Chapter 19 of the North American Free Trade Agreement had allowed Canadian softwood lumber exporters to avoid duties. Navarro said that the Canadians \"have played us.\" And like Trump, Navarro has put other countries on notice that the United States would confront its major trading partners even when they are close allies. In a -Jan. 31 interview with the Financial Times, Navarro sent shock waves through Europe when he said that Germany was getting an unfair competitive advantage by manipulating the euro to lower its value and make its exports -cheaper. In 1996, Peter Navarro, then a Democrat, hoped that the backlash against the \"Republican Revolution\" led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich would sweep Democrats into office. Navarro used this flier in his unsuccessful campaign to unseat Rep. Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.). 'The one that got away' Navarro got his start in politics at the local level - as a Democrat. He ran unsuccessfully for mayor of San Diego in 1992, city council in 1993, county supervisor in 1994 and Congress in 1996. \"My citizen activism is a direct outgrowth of a classical and fiscally conservative training in economics at Harvard,\" he wrote in \"San Diego Confidential,\" a revealing, cutting and readable memoir of his years in politics there. \"It is a perspective rooted in one of the most important concepts in economics - the need for government intervention in the presence of a market failure.\" Initially he became active in a popular local group called Prevent Los Angelization Now (PLAN) opposing developers. \"A city should decide where it doesn't want to develop,\" he wrote, \"saving at least some of the canyons and hillsides and wetlands from the bulldozer's blade.\" But instead of running for county supervisor, a race he might have won, Navarro jumped into the San Diego mayor's race. His opponent, Susan Golding, launched three negative ads and he responded with an ad attacking Golding, whose ex-husband was convicted of laundering illegal drug money. Ahead in the polls going into the last weekend of the race, Navarro attacked her again in a televised debate. In tears, she called the attacks on her family unfair; Navarro accused her of rehearsing the response and came off as dismissive. He lost. Years later, he wrote that he still thought about \"the one that got away.\" \"He was almost the mayor,\" said Larry Remer, a political consultant who worked on three of Navarro's campaigns after that one. \"He flubbed it, is what really -happened.\" Remer said Navarro was a hard-working candidate who \"realized the need to stay on a clear, concise message, a lot like 'make America great again.' Nothing could appeal to people in San Diego more than saying 'not L.A.' \" But, he added, what undid Navarro as a candidate was his personality. \"He would just burn through volunteers,\" Remer said. \"He's not quite as prickly as Trump, but he has the same ego issues.\" In 1996, Navarro took on then-U.S. Rep. Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.), hoping that the backlash to the Newt Gingrich revolution would sweep a Democrat into the House. He later wrote that Bilbray \"was as much of an idiot as he was when he first ran\" for Congress \"but this time he was an idiot with a record - a bad one.\" Nonetheless, heavily outspent, Navarro lost soundly. Discouraged, divorced and in debt, he moved on. In the mid-2000s, Navarro latched onto the issue of China's growing global ambitions. (Pearson FT Press) A 'decent trade deal' Navarro resurrected his public persona by turning to writing, doing a set of online basic economics books and a how-to investing book titled \"If It's Raining in Brazil, Buy Starbucks.\" In the mid-2000s Navarro latched onto the issue of China's growing global ambitions, writing \"The Coming China Wars,\" \"Death by China\" and \"Crouching Tiger; What China's Militarism Means for the World.\" According to the New Yorker, Navarro in 2011 read that Trump told the Chinese state news agency Xinhua that he liked Navarro's first book on China. They communicated after that but met in person only during the presidential campaign, when Navarro was one of the few economists to take Trump seriously. At times, Navarro sounds moderate. \"The last thing a Trump administration plans is a trade war,\" he said at a Tax Policy Center event in October. \"The issue simply is getting a decent trade deal with each of the major trading partners.\" And many of the issues he raises about China are real: Chinese companies steal intellectual property, receive cheap credit from Chinese banks, pay lower wages, and generally cough up more pollution and pay less for pollution controls. Navarro estimated in 2006 that unfair trade practices accounted for 41 percent of China's competitive advantage over U.S. firms. But the film, in which Navarro attempts to be toward China what Michael Moore is to the automobile industry, is hyperbolic in tone. It includes comments by conservatives fearful of China, AFL-CIO leader Richard L. Trumka, ordinary shoppers and Navarro himself, who fires salvos at American corporations that do business in China. The narrator says that \"no company has been happier\" to move its capital offshore than General Electric. Then Navarro appears and interjects. \"When I go out and do speeches to corporate audiences on China, they want me to talk about strategy,\" he says. \"It's like, 'Hey, you're going over to China. You're giving them your avionics so you can participate in a regional jet game in China, and two or three or five years from now you're going to try to sell your regional jets in Europe - and your biggest competitor is going to be that China guy. How stupid is that?' \" Peter Navarro, a University of California at Irvine business professor and economist, seen in August, is one of President Trump's most visible advisers on the economy. (Leonard Ortiz/Orange County Register) Criticism over tax proposals Navarro's toughest audience has been his fellow economists. He started his career writing a book about the utility industry. In a review, Robert A. O'Neill, now a specialist in electricity regulation at the law firm McCarter & English, said its indictment of the regulatory process \"greatly simplifies the complex issues affecting the electric utility industry.\" He said that readers would \"find ample reason simply to discount the book as pro-utility -propaganda.\" Now, as a key Trump adviser, Navarro has run into more flak. In a paper he wrote last year with now-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Navarro said that Trump could impose tariffs and encourage changes in consumer buying habits to erase the huge U.S. trade deficit. That would go hand in hand with greater investment in the U.S. economy, a combination of events that William Gale, a Brookings Institution economist, has called \"mathematically impossible.\" Navarro and Ross say that getting rid of the trade deficit and boosting investment would also spur faster economic growth, which would bring in $1.74 trillion in tax revenue over a decade. Hooey, say economists across the political spectrum. (Navarro declined to answer questions in emails or respond to phone calls.) N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers and a Harvard University economics professor, said in a September blog post that Navarro and Ross's paper makes elementary mistakes by overstating growth and not understanding that a smaller trade deficit means lower investment along with possibly higher interest rates and less consumption. \"Even a freshman at the end of ec 10 knows that trade deficits go hand in hand with capital inflows,\" Mankiw wrote. In addition, if the United States erects tariff barriers to China, factories might go to other lower-cost countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh or India. Furman said that \"if you're trying to intimidate companies about moving operations or yell at them over supply chains, that's not the way to make America a more attractive place. The way to do that is to build infrastructure, train workers and invest in technology, not to just beat up on other -countries.\" Navarro and Ross have also come under criticism for their tax proposals. A tax credit for infrastructure would reward projects that would happen anyway and would not address long-overdue maintenance, experts say, leading to larger budget deficits. Navarro's close relationship with Ross could serve him well when Cabinet members arrive and leadership on issues grows more fractured, potentially creating rivalries with more savvy infighters such as National Economic Council head Gary Cohn. Yet for now, Navarro and Ross appear to be in sync with the president and his threats on trade. That position is one that Navarro has held for at least a decade. His \"Death by China\" film takes a video of Obama speaking in the White House briefing room and splices in a Chinese soldier who removes the White House insignia behind Obama and puts up a Chinese flag. The film also shows an empty factory with broken windows and unemployment lines, and juxtaposes that with Chinese container ships and busy Chinese factory workers. In the end, the credits roll to the tune of a glum, folky song whose lyrics Navarro helped write. \"Look around, tell me what you see. Every day more people in the street. I used to work in a factory. By now I'd work for anything It's not me, it's my family I wish to feed. Not much, we got simple needs. Too bad they sent our jobs away. In China they're not workers, they're just slaves. People, wait, it's a world of trade and greed. And the CEOs get richer, and our jobs all move offshore.\" It could be an ode describing the plight of Trump's supporters. And it struck a chord with one crucial viewer, who said in a blurb on the film's Web page: \"Death by China\" is right on. This important documentary depicts our problem with China with facts, figures and insight. I urge you to see it.\" The reviewer: Donald Trump.

            "body": "GAO, Mali Since World War II, U.N. peacekeepers have been dispatched to 69 conflicts - civil wars, border disputes and failed states. But now they are confronting an unsettling new threat: al-Qaeda. Here in the vast, lawless desert of northwest Africa, their convoys are being torn apart by improvised explosive devices and their compounds blasted by 1,000-pound car bombs. It is a crisis that looks more like the U.S. ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan than the cease-fires traditionally monitored by U.N. missions. In the past four years, 118 peacekeepers have been killed - making the U.N. mission in Mali, known as MINUSMA, the deadliest ever. The bloodshed has raised questions about how an institution developed in the 1940s can serve a world under threat from the Islamic State and al-Qaeda. The issue is especially potent given the expectation that U.N. peacekeepers will eventually go to places such as Syria and Libya. \"We are trying to learn these lessons here, rather than in Iraq, Libya or Syria,\" said Dutch Col. Mike Kerkhove, commander of the U.N. intelligence unit in Mali. \"This is not the end of this type of mission. It's the beginning.\" In 2012, Islamist radicals linked to al-Qaeda hijacked an uprising by ethnic Tuareg people and went on to seize cities across northern Mali, holding on for nearly a year until they were forced out by a French military intervention. When 11,000 U.N. troops arrived in 2013, they were meant to protect a fledgling peace deal and train the Malian army. But Islamist extremists regrouped across the region. It did not take long before the militants started targeting peacekeepers, whom they dubbed \"Crusader occupation forces.\" The United Nations was remarkably unprepared for the threat. Most of its troops from Africa and South Asia brought tanks and vehicles that were easy targets for explosives, unlike U.S. mine-resistant vehicles. The U.N. compounds, dotted with metal storage containers turned into offices- and bedrooms, had flimsy perimeter security and were vulnerable to the massive car bombs used by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), the regional affiliate of the extremist group. For a while, U.N. forces- didn't have a single attack helicopter. \"We weren't ready for these challenges,\" said Mohamed El-Amine Souef, a native of the Comoros Islands who is the top U.N. official in Gao, a city in northern Mali. Last year, Souef's compound was struckby a suicide bomber, the shrapnel battering his front door. But the United Nations' dilemma goes beyond a lack of preparation or anti-terrorism equipment. At its New York headquarters and around the world, diplomats are debating: Should U.N. forces be engaged in counterterrorism at all? \"It's time for us to realize that this kind of front-line role is central to the future of the United Nations,\" said Peter Yeo, a senior official at the U.N. Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that supports the goals of the world body. Yeo and others argue that without a counterterrorism capability, U.N. peacekeepers can't operate productively in many of the world's war zones. But critics say that such a role would violate the peacekeepers' core principle of impartiality and ultimately make them less effective. \"Peacekeepers are only meant to use deadly force to protect civilians or to stop spoilers from threatening a peace process, not to pursue any group's military defeat,\" said Aditi Gorur, director of the Protecting Civilians in Conflict program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based research center. If peacekeepers had a more aggressive counterterrorism mandate, she and others argue, that could hurt the United Nations' ability to mediate between warring groups, which sometimes include violent Islamists. Already in Mali, the International Committee of the Red Cross has described the United Nations as a \"party to the conflict.\" In the slide-show presentation he shows to visitors at his base in Bamako, the capital of Mali, Kerkhove includes an aerial photo taken last year of a compound that appeared to be used by a terrorist group. When he received the photo, Kerkhove debated what to do. The men inside might be planning an assault on U.N. personnel, he thought, or a strike against civilians. Over the past two years, extremist groups have used Mali as a staging ground for attacks on luxury hotels, beach resorts and restaurants in West Africa. In 2016, al-Qaeda and its allies and affiliates launched at least 257 attacks in the region, according to the Long War Journal. But Kerkhove knew that the nearest battalion of U.N. troops, from Senegal, didn't have the weapons or air support to engage in a fight with trans-national terrorists. Ultimately, U.N. forces- decided not to approach the compound. The Mali mission is the only one of the 16 active U.N. peacekeeping operations that authorizes troops to deter and counter \"asymmetric threats\" - that is, terrorist groups - that could harm its work or civilians. Last year, the U.N. Security Council said the mission should become \"more proactive and robust\" - language that some read as encouraging more offensive operations. \"We need to be able to hit the terrorists where they are, before they hit us,\" said Souef, the U.N. official in Gao. But peacekeepers worry that they don't have the tools to deal with armed extremists. \"We are gathering the intelligence, but we lack the forces- who can act on that information,\" said Swedish Lt. Col. Per Wilson. Richard Gowan, an expert on U.N. peacekeeping at New York University's Center on International Cooperation, said that U.N. missions lack the resources- and doctrine for counter-terrorism work. He noted that even well-equipped Western military forces- were outmaneuvered by terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"It is reasonable to ask why on earth the Security Council thinks that a U.N. force can do any better in Mali, even with European reinforcements,\" he said. Over the years, the United Nations has increasingly had to confront the scourge of terrorism. Militants blew up its political assistance office in Baghdad in 2003, killing 22 people, including the U.N. envoy, Sergio Vieira de Mello. But the Mali mission marks the first time a significant peacekeeping contingent has been sent to help a state regain control over areas contested by terrorist groups. In a review in 2015, a panel of U.N.-appointed experts said that peacekeeping forces- were \"not the appropriate tool for military counter-terrorism operations.\" But it noted they do deploy in areas threatened by armed extremist groups \"and must be capable of operating effectively and as safely as possible therein.\" On their patrols through the sandy side streets of Gao, an ancient city along the Niger River lined with mud-brick houses, U.N. convoys are greeted by throngs of residents. The locals always have the same complaint, said Senegalese Capt. Diagne Meth, standing outside his armored personnel carrier during one patrol: \"They want us to do more.\" Specifically, he said, they ask for more offensive operations, targeting radical Islamists as well as criminal groups. \"But I have to tell them, 'That's not what we're here to do,' \" Meth said. Already, the United Nations has tried to adapt in Mali. It has a fleet of surveillance drones. It has the first U.N. intelligence cell, a Bamako-based unit with analysts spread across the country. It has counter-IED specialists. It also has thousands of European troops, including large contingents from Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, with soldiers experienced in fighting in Afghanistan. Other U.N. missions have evolved in recognition of new threats. In Congo in 2013, for example, the United Nations launched its first brigade designed for offensive operations. But the terrorism threat in Mali sets it apart. \"Sending out a patrol might work to deter an armed group in the Congo from engaging in violence, but it has the opposite effect in Mali, where terrorists are specifically trying to target peacekeepers,\" said Gorur, of the Stimson Center. More than a year and a half ago, Mali's government signed a peace deal with separatist rebels in the north from the Tuareg and Arab communities. Authorities hoped the radical Islamists who had once aligned themselves with the local rebels - and later fallen out - had been driven away. But today, the terrorists appear stronger than ever. The French military continues to conduct its own counter-terrorism mission across northwest Africa, including in Mali. The United Nations shares information with the French if it is deemed useful for protecting the lives of troops. On Jan. 18, Islamist extremists drove a truck laden with explosives into a compound in Gao where the United Nations was protecting Malian -forces. Seventy-six men - from national forces- and armed groups that had joined the peace process - lost their lives in the blast. (No peacekeepers were killed.) The attack was claimed by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which said it involved one of its allies, al-Mourabitoun. The explosion was staggering, but so was the lack of security at an installation ostensibly protected by peacekeepers. Three days before the attack, a visiting Washington Post reporter saw only a few Bangladeshi peacekeepers sitting inside a personnel carrier outside the compound. Terrorist groups had already struck U.N. facilities in the city several times, but the base was protected by only a flimsy metal gate. Souef, the U.N. official, acknowledged that his own compound in the city was vulnerable. \"We shouldn't be living in a place like this,\" he said.",

            "body": "Modern dance choreographer Mark Morris in his Brooklyn studios. (Helayne Seidman/For The Washington Post) In the 37 years since he founded his dance company, Mark Morris has been a dancer, a choreographer and even a conductor, on occasion. Now he is taking on a new role, for the Mark Morris Dance Group's upcoming performances at George Mason University: baritone. For both shows, on Feb. 24 and 25, Morris will sing the medley of deliciously risqu\u00e9 songs from the 1920s and '30s that accompany \"Dancing Honeymoon,\" a sly romp he created nearly 20 years ago. The songs, including \"Wild Thyme,\" \"Do Do Do\" \"And Her Mother Came, Too,\" were made famous by Gertrude Lawrence and Jack Buchanan, two of the era's beloved British entertainers. The lyrics are a wee bit dirty, if you listen closely, but they're also charming, clever and witty.  So is the dancing. This is one of Morris's funniest works. That's the part he'd rather talk about, instead of his singing.  [The colorful restraint of the Mark Morris Dance Group] \"It's not like a showboating thing,\" he insists, speaking by phone from his company's dance center in Brooklyn. \"It's not like, at long last I'm making my singing debut. I don't want a standing ovation. I'm just singing with the band.\" Still, the singing choreographer is a pretty rare thing. Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly come to mind; like Morris, both men had pleasant but not conventionally ideal voices. Morris, 60, acknowledges that his range is rather narrow, but that suits the \"Dancing Honeymoon\" material. Lawrence's own range was small. Known as \"the glorious Gertie,\" and considered by many to be the first international superstar, she was a great performer rather than a great singer. But she didn't let that stop her. The Mark Morris Dance Group performing \"Dancing Honeymoon\" in Jacobs Pillow, 2011. (Christopher Duggan) Morris has always loved to sing. Growing up in Seattle, he sang at home with his family. His parents were big-band fans, and that's when he heard the vintage pop songs that would inspire \"Dancing Honeymoon.\" He sang in the chorus all through school. Singing made Sundays bearable: \"When I was forced to go to church, which I detested, I sang in the choir.\"  After he joined a Balkan folk-dance group as a teenager, he sang Croatian and Serbian music. Later, his passion for choral music led him to create some of his most masterful dance works, such as the exquisite evening-length meditation on states of being, \"L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato,\" accompanied by the Handel oratorio of the same name, and \"Dido and Aeneas,\" a dance-drama accompanied by the Henry Purcell opera. (Morris will conduct when his group performs \"Dido\" at Brooklyn Academy of Music next month.) Vocals have inspired several other Morris works, and he has directed numerous operas. [Mark Morris designs a dance after he picks his music] He recently began a weekly singing period with his dancers, as part of their cross-training. They sing together after lunch. \"It's so good for people to sing,\" Morris says. \"People get along better when they sing together. And it teaches you another thing about breathing. And it's fun.\" But singing in public? Morris had to screw up his courage for that. The past couple of times \"Dancing Honeymoon\" was in the repertory, in 2011 and 2002, he was tempted to sing - but only briefly. \"I auditioned myself and I was too scared,\" he says. \"I didn't think I'd do it well enough.\" This time, he auditioned for his longtime executive director, Nancy Umanoff, and got a qualified go-ahead. \"She said, 'Yeah, if you practice.' \" He has been practicing.  \"It's nervous-making,\" Morris admits. \"I've been rehearsing enough, and I have the [guts] enough to sing it. I have a pretty good voice. I'm not a nightmare.\" A performance of \"A Forest in Brooklyn,\" 2016. (Ani Collier) Morris is famed for his commitment to live music for all performances - a wonderful thing, and so unusual that it sets his company apart among modern-dance groups. His troupe travels with its own music ensemble. (At George Mason, in the pit along with Morris will be a pianist, violinist and percussionist.) In addition to \"Dancing Honeymoon,\" the Mark Morris Dance Group will perform the solo \"Serenade,\" set to the Serenade for Guitar and Percussion by the late Lou Harrison, one of Morris's favorite composers and a friend. Two new works complete the program: \"A Forest,\" with music by another Morris favorite, Haydn (his Piano Trio no. 44 in E), and \"Pure Dance Items,\" with Indian-influenced music by the American composer Terry Riley (from his \"Salome Dances for Peace\"). By the way, this is only the second venue where Morris will sing, and his dancers will perform, in \"Dancing Honeymoon.\" The first was last month at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This will be the last, for now. The company has no plans to stage the work in the near future. Along with vocals, Morris has always had a fondness for world music - which he prefers simply to call \"music\" - and his latest, grandest project combines both. It's an evening-length work titled \"Layla and Majnun,\" based on a classic Persian love story, which was turned into a 1908 opera by the Azerbaijani composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov. For Morris's dance-drama, the music is performed in a chamber arrangement by the Silk Road Ensemble. Renowned Azerbaijani vocalists Alim Qasimov and Fargana Qasimova also perform in this work, along with other Azerbaijani singers and musicians. It premiered last fall in Berkeley, Calif., and will tour nationally and internationally. (The Kennedy Center is among the commissioners.) About a decade ago, cellist Yo-Yo Ma had asked Morris about turning it into a stage production. Morris was inclined, but didn't think it was the right time. \"I didn't want it to be airport-giftshop multiculturalism,\" he says. \"I didn't want it to be 'Aladdin' on Broadway.\"  So Morris put the idea aside until he could research it properly. Along the way, an Islamic love story began to feel pretty hot. \"This is probably a good time to do it, because everyone is so insanely f----- up about Islam,\" he says. \"But as I said the first day of rehearsal, this is not in any way a political corrective. It's not a cure for what I perceive is ailing us.\" It's simply, he says, \"very, very beautiful, sad, tender and romantic.\" \"I never felt this was dangerous territory. I just waited till I knew more and understood more.\" Mark Morris Dance Group Feb. 24 and 25 at George Mason University. Visit cfa.gmu.edu.",

Hunter recalled being uncertain why Peterson was favoring that part of his body until he leaned in for closer examination. \"I knew something was wrong, but I didn't know what until that round, when he stood up and started pushing the knot,\" Hunter said. \"It was a knot almost like something out of the movie 'Aliens.' \" Peterson had a severe abdominal cramp, as it turned out, but he still managed to defeat Felix Diaz at EagleBank Arena in Fairfax . Peterson had weathered frequent cramping throughout his body that night, leading Hunter to conclude that it was time for the former super lightweight champion to move up in weight class. So when Peterson (34-3-1, 17 knockouts) steps into the ring at Cintas Center in Cincinnati on Saturday night to face David Avanesyan for the World Boxing Association welterweight championship, he'll do so at 147 pounds for the first time in his career. The climb to a heavier division has resulted in far less stress on Peterson's body in trying to make weight. It also follows a natural progression on the heels of Peterson's past two fights, contested at catchweights of 144 and 143 pounds, respectively. Peterson, 33, revealed during a workout for the media last week just how much he has taken to becoming a welterweight. \"In the past I hated you all for coming here,\" Peterson said from Bald Eagle boxing annex, his home gym in Southwest Washington. \"Struggling with weight, having to talk and do an extra workout that doesn't really mean anything to me at this point. Basically I didn't like it when y'all showed up. \"But today, I have much more energy. Pretty sure you could probably see it in the workout, much more energy in the workout. Actually, it was fun today.\" The move to 147 pounds also means perhaps more lucrative paydays, given the quality fighters in the division generally regarded as the most demanding in the sport. Notable welterweights include Manny Pacquiao, Keith Thurman, Danny Garcia, Shawn Porter, Amir Khan and Adrien Broner, who is co-headlining Saturday's card. Peterson has fought several of those standouts at lower weights, including a memorable bout against Garcia on April 11, 2015, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Garcia won in a majority decision, with two judges scoring the fight 115-113 and a third calling it a draw at 114-all, but Peterson was landing with much more frequency and authority during the championship rounds. By the end of the fight, Peterson's face showed barely any indication of damage. Garcia, however, had bruising and puffiness around his eyes as well as multiple cuts and scrapes along the right side of his face. In another signature bout, Peterson defeated Khan via split decision to claim the WBA and International Boxing Federation 140-pound titles on Dec. 10, 2011, at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. The fight included some controversy, with Khan being deducted one point in the seventh and 12th rounds for pushing. \"If you look at the roster at 147, you can almost take that roster back to the days of old when you had Ray Leonard, you had [Marvin] Hagler, you had [Thomas] Hearns, you had [Wilfred] Benitez, all these great fighters at 147,\" Hunter said. \"Now if we can put these guys today in the ring and let them do it, we'll take boxing back to its glory days.\" Peterson is set to fight for his first title since August 9, 2014, when he scored a knockout of Edgar Santana in an IBF super lightweight bout at Barclays Center, and will be facing a Russian-born opponent making just his second appearance in the United States. The 28-year-old Avanesyan (22-1-1, 11 KOs) is coming off a unanimous decision over Shane Mosley nearly nine months ago, claiming what was then the interim WBA welterweight title. Peterson, meanwhile, is about to end one of the longest layoffs of his career. He last went more than one year without a fight between his victory over Khan and a knockout of Kendall Holt 14 months later. \"At this point, I'm not anxious to get in there,\" Peterson said. \"I'm a vet in this game now. Fights come as they come. If it's 16 months or two years later, as long as I'm motivated to get in the ring, I'm going to take my time and do it right.\"",

            "body": "Michael Kahn, longtime artistic director of Shakespeare Theatre Company, will leave that position after the 2018-2019 season. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) On any given night, in the houses that Michael Kahn built, you could find yourself transported to Illyria or Bohemia, to Dunsinane or Athens. Next to you might be seated a justice of the Supreme Court or an accountant from Gaithersburg or an English teacher from Manassas - all slaking their classical thirsts. Up on the stages of his Shakespeare Theatre Company, you were apt to encounter actors, nationally known or locally grown, scratching the same itch. One month it could be Stacy Keach in \"King Lear\" or Charlayne Woodard in \"The Taming of the Shrew\"; another it might be Nancy Robinette in a drama by Oscar Wilde or Tom Story in a comedy by Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Stacy Keach as King Lear, Jonno Roberts as Edmund, Laura Odeh as Cordelia, and Kate Arrington as Regan in \"King Lear,\" directed by Robert Falls. (Carol Rosegg) They, and you, have Kahn to thank for setting iambic pentameter to a Washington beat; for expanding by some impressive magnitude the District's appreciation of Shakespeare and a slew of other playwrights of antiquity, the Renaissance, the Spanish Golden Age and beyond. A diet hewing to a Western palate, to be sure, but also one that often tried to extend the menu and expand the table of dramatic possibility. For that, the region owes this proud, cosmopolitan man of insight and taste its warmest congratulations. [Michael Kahn comes to Washington] Kahn revealed last week that he will be relinquishing his artistic directorship of the company at the end of the 2018-2019 season, an announcement that reduces by one major figure the number of Founding Fathers (and Mothers) running the region's stages. Among the major companies, only Howard Shalwitz and Eric Schaeffer, both a generation or so younger than Kahn, remain. And yet, given the distance Washington theater has traveled since Kahn arrived in 1986, his departure won't be quite the seismic event it might have been, even a few short years ago. Yes, for sentimental and, certainly, artistic reasons, the change at the top of the company will have a sizable impact. But because Washington has matured into a theater town with such a variegated constellation of companies, creating and presenting drama in every category, there's little worry that on a personnel level, the inspirational vacuum can't be filled. [Michael Kahn plots his Shakespeare Theatre exit for 2019] Except, perhaps, at the very company Kahn will leave behind. As Nelson Pressley reported last week in these pages, Kahn has vowed to bequeath to the next artistic director a fiscally sound organization, with its accounts in order. But any longtime patron of the company, observing how the quality of its seasons has taken a hit over the past several years, has to be concerned about what has been sacrificed in the efforts to juggle programming in its two spaces, its longtime home in the Lansburgh Theatre on Seventh Street NW, and, since 2007, its larger, grander theater, the $89 million, 775-seat Sidney Harman Hall on F Street. A perusal of the selections made so far for the 2017-18 season reveals how conservative the company's programming has grown. Where once it regularly ventured into daring terrain, producing some of the thorniest plays of Shakespeare, and uncovering some of the forgotten treasures of the Elizabethan and Jacobean ages, the titles now suggest that it is making a conscious choice to lead from behind. The Shakespeares in the offing are default, brand-name titles: \"Hamlet\" and \"Twelfth Night,\" with a third, \"Othello,\" revived as the summer Free-for-All entry. A visiting production from Ireland, Samuel Beckett's absurdist masterpiece, \"Waiting for Godot,\" is another scheduled war horse, along with a revival of - wait for it - Lerner and Loewe's 1960 King Arthur musical, \"Camelot.\" The one unconventional selection (with a sixth show still to be named) is a double bill of Harold Pinter one-acts, \"The Collection\" and \"The Lover,\" directed, tellingly, by Kahn, who of late has been directing more and more at other theaters around town, although he will also stage the company's \"Hamlet.\" Still, for an organization that declares that its vision is \"to ignite a dialogue that connects the universality of classic works to our shared human experience in the modern world,\" it's hard to see where the ignition occurs with a stolid musical that's regularly performed by community groups and high school drama clubs everywhere. The cast of Shakespeare Theatre Company's production of \"The Secret Garden,\" directed by David Armstrong. (Teresa Wood) It's only been since the addition of Harman Hall that the company has been thumbing through Broadway songbooks to beef up its box office; recently, \"The Secret Garden\" was the decidedly nonclassical choice for this classical theater. \"Kiss Me, Kate\" and \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" have cropped up at the Shakespeare, as well. It's a far cry from the more inventive crops the company used to harvest, through its own exciting commissions, such as an adaptation by John Strand of the French \"closet play\" \"Lorenzaccio,\" or, as recently as four years ago, a twin bill of Friedrich Schiller's \"Wallenstein,\" in a new translation by Robert Pinsky, with a production of \"Coriolanus.\" And although an inspired production can still materialize, such as the just-opened \"King Charles III,\" co-produced with two West Coast companies, informed spectators are sure to notice that exceptional programming is now the rare exception. Whoever is to succeed the estimable Kahn will have to think long and hard with the board and business side of the organization about whether the now 10-year-long experience of running Shakespeare as a two-theater behemoth, with a total of more than 1,200 seats to fill, is a burden or a blessing. Harry Smith as Prince Harry, Robert Joy as King Charles and Michelle Beck as Jessica in the American Conservatory Theater production of \"King Charles III.\" (Kevin Berne) The company needs to be on its guard because, pound for pound, it is being eclipsed for ingenuity and nimbleness by its crosstown colleagues at Folger Theatre, which these days has become, with a shorter schedule, the go-to local troupe for classical innovation. The visits by scrappy up-and-comers such as Fiasco Theatre, as well as overseas visitors such as Shakespeare's Globe and local playwright-directors such as Aaron Posner, have given Folger an unmatched imaginative momentum. One can look back appreciatively, of course, on many one-of-a-kind classical offerings Kahn championed, in the conviction that he was cultivating a local audience that would itself grow ever more sophisticated. I think of the superior comedies, among them, his staging of Ben Jonson's \"The Silent Woman\" and Shakespeare's \"Love's Labor's Lost,\" as well as Keith Baxter's direction of Sheridan's \"The Rivals.\" High points too, were Kahn's teamwork with dramatist playwright David Ives on adaptations of \"The Liar\" and \"The Heir Apparent\" as were the work of Rebecca Bayla Taichman on her Italian holiday of a \"Taming of the Shrew,\" Douglas Wager on a \"Comedy of Errors\" redolent of Hollywood back lots and Ethan McSweeny, via a heart-stopping \"The Persians.\" A mile-long parade of notable actors has marched through with distinction: among them, David Sabin, Floyd King, Franchelle Stewart Dorn, Patrick Page, Michael Hayden, Holly Twyford, Patrick Stewart, John Hurt, Elizabeth Ashley, Bruce Dow, Suzanne Bertish, Andrew Long, Tana Hicken, Finn Wittrock, Edward Gero, Philip Goodwin, and on and on and on. That's what you call a legacy. As Kahn graciously paves the way for his successor, let's hope the company finds the wisdom - and the Will - to preserve the best of it.",

            "body": "(iStock) (Update: Adding information about district, clarifying sourcing of quote) During the campaign, President Trump said \"it is time\" for merit pay for teachers. In Florida, the Orange County Public School district thinks otherwise, declaring a years-long experiment with performance pay a failure. [Trump's perplexing comments about education] According to the Orlando Sentinel, a report by the district, given to the Central Florida Public School Boards Coalition, says plainly: \"Performance pay systems are not an effective way to increase student achievement,\" the report concluded. The paper wrote: If they were, there would be consistent improvements since the law went into effect. Instead, Orange's fourth-graders have shown declining performance in language arts while its sixth graders have gotten better in that subject. And its third graders have posted flat scores in math, year after year. On national tests, Florida's eighth-graders have done worse, in both math and reading, since the law's passage. Experiments with merit pay for teachers have been tried for decades, but there is no evidence that they work in improving student performance. Florida, starting under the 1999-2007 administration of former governor Jeb Bush, has been at the forefront of the movement, requiring that districts implement a performance pay plan by 2003 - but there wasn't a great deal of district buy-in because there was no state funding for the program.  In 2011, Republican Gov. Rick Scott passed a new law changing the way teaches were evaluated - with 50 percent linked to student standardized test scores - and creating a performance-based pay system as well as ending job protections. [Ravitch: The long, failed history of merit pay] The Sentinel reported that officials in Orange County - which is the ninth largest school district in the United States (excluding Hawaii, which is a single district for the entire state) - want the law changed and plan to share the report with Florida legislators. Diane Ravitch, an education historian before she became a prominent anti-corporate school reform advocate, has written extensively about merit pay, noting in this 2010 piece: One of the signature issues of business people and conservative Republicans for the past 30 years has been merit pay. They believe in competition, and they believe that financial rewards can be used to incentivize better performance, so it seems natural for them to conclude that merit pay or performance pay would incentivize teachers to produce better results. Note that they assume that most people - in this case, teachers - are lazy and need a promise of dollars to be incentivized to get higher scores for their students. It never seems to occur to them that many people are doing their best (think people who play sports, always striving to do their best without any expectation of payment) and continue to do so because of intrinsic rewards or because of an innate desire to serve others. Teachers should certainly be well compensated, but not many enter the classroom with money as their primary motivation. Although teachers need and want higher pay, they are strongly opposed to individual merit pay. They know that it destroys the collaboration and teamwork that are essential to the culture of the school. They know this even though few of them are familiar with the work of W. Edwards Deming, the business guru, who warned American business against ratings and merit pay. (See Andrea Gabor's \"The Man Who Discovered Quality,\" Chapter 9.) Deming said it nourishes rivalry and short-term planning, while undermining morale and long-term planning. Few people realize that merit pay schemes have been tried again and again since the 1920s. Belief in them waxes and wanes, but the results have never been robust. Now we have the findings of the most thorough trial of teacher merit pay, conducted by first-rate economists at Vanderbilt University's National Center for Performance Incentives. Many people expected that this trial would show positive results because the bonus for getting higher scores was so large: Teachers in the treatment group could get up to $15,000 for higher scores. After a three-year trial, the researchers concluded that the teachers in the treatment group did not get better results than those in the control group, who were not in line to get a bonus. There was a gain for 5th graders in the treatment group, but it washed out in 6th grade. Bottom line: Merit pay made no difference. Teachers were working as hard as they knew how, whether for a bonus or not. Here's how Peter Greene, a Pennsylvania teacher who writes the lively Curmudgucation blog, sarcastically describes the \"allure\" of Florida - with its evaluation and pay policies - to prospective teachers in a passage he took from a 2010 Economist piece: [Teacher: 'That is so not okay'] HEY THERE, talented recent university graduate! I'd like to offer you a job in an extremely challenging and rewarding field. The pay is based almost entirely on performance metrics - you know, what they used to call \"commission\" in the old days. The better you do, the more you earn! Of course the worse you do, the less you earn, but don't focus on that - you're a winner, you'll do great. We can offer you a five-year contract to start. By \"contract\" I mean we'll let you work for us, if things work out, but we can of course fire you at any time. And after that you'll have solid contracts! Each contract lasts one year, and we can decide to let you go at the end if you're not performing up to our standards. And by that time, you'll be earning ... well, actually, you'll be paid at exactly the same rate as when you started out. We're prohibited by law from paying you more just because you've worked for us longer. If, however, you want to go get qualified in some new technical field or obtain an advanced degree, then ... we can't raise your pay either. We basically just pay you a flat standardized commission depending on how well you perform on the mission. The mission is to train 18 to 25 children to correctly fill out the answers on a series of standardized tests. You have no control over which children will be assigned to you, and unlike other commission-based workers (door-to-door salesmen, say), you will be stuck with the ones you're handed for the whole year. Average salary is $45,000 a year, but if you work your butt off and get lucky with the kids who are assigned to you, you could push it to, oh, $60,000.",

                "Just a thought.... what if we incentivize the root of student achievement, which starts with their foundation before they get to school... the parents.   It is a fact the lower the income the closer it relates to lower scores for a variety of reasons like nutrition, hunger, family issues, lack of a foundation when younger, parents who can't read, drug/alcohol, genetics, etc.  so many factors hold kids back, those with a more stable home with parents who encourage reading at a younger age do better.  If there was more reason to be engaged there might be more of a reason to try and overcome those obstacles.  Teachers can only do so much with what they have for as long as they have the students.  Extra pay can't fix the issues students are dealing with on a daily basis.  I would be no different if dentists were incentivized to have less cavities and the less their patients have the more they got paid.  They can only do so much unless they visited homes every day to ensure they took care of their teeth correctly.",
                "(MrPinzy): \".... what if we incentivize the root of student achievement, which starts with their foundation before they get to school... the parents.\"\nI like it. The State of Alaska  subsidizes homeschooling through enrollment in district-run correspondence schools. Parents get some amount ($3000 per pupil-year last I read). Test for eligibility at the start of the year and performance at the end. If your child is at or above age-level expectations at the end of the contract year, you get the money. Maybe limit the policy to one contract per adult to avoid subsidizing population growth.",
                "The joking reference to job \"contracts\" demonstrates a feeble ignorance of the reality of knowledge work. Very few people really work on contracts. \n\nDo opponents of merit pay believe all teachers should receive the same salary? If the don't all receive the same salary, what metric is better than how well they are doing in their job to determine their salary?  If you say \"years in service\", you are part of the problem.",
                "not all teacher get the same pay . it's called sinority . and as the contracts keep on rolling every 4-5 years . the pay raise goes higher .( only thing it means a higher union fee) as well) .\n as far  as the merit , there was one state where more then half of the teachers failed . and no tenya . thats slowly going .",
                "Dunno where I fall in on the critic to supporter continuum.  Administrators in the NEA/AFT/AFSCME cartel's schools (the \"public\" schools) cannot make merit pay work because of institutional constraints (\"political reality\"). Furthermore, they do not have the financial incentive to make merit pay work (what's in it for them?). Management techniques evolve. Accountability mechanisms evolve. This is one reason to support a competitive market in education services. A market is an on-going experiment in how to combine resources to meet consumer desires. Bureaucracies are as close as humans come to eternal life.  As P. J. O'Rourke observed: \"Evolution doesn't work on things that don't die.\"",
                "Good question, what exactly is the metric you are going to use to determine the \"merit\" of a teacher?  Is it how well they do their job on a daily basis, or how well their students score on a one-shot standardized test?",
                "The headline is sort of misleading.  It's not just that one Florida school system that's pointed out that merit pay for teachers doesn't work--it's literally EVERYONE who has impartially looked at the results.\n\nThe article gets that more or less straight.  But the headline underplays just how debunked this bad idea is at this point.",
                "Yet all teachers aren't paid the same- is whatever other system is creating salary differentials superior to how well they are doing in their job?",
                "conditional, the reason some teachers get paid more is that experience, in any job, means that person is worth more.  This is very true in teaching because classroom management is a difficult thing to learn about theoretically, it takes time in the classroom to learn how to be effective.",
                "One of the better articles on merit pay for teachers I've seen. \n\nOne of my siblings is a serious businessman, and he is a great admirer of Demings, the business guru mentioned in the article. Among the reasons he likes Demings is the notion that one has to take away fear in the workplace, as it affects the morale of people working. I've felt that fear, when I worked in a private school where we were on 'at-will' contracts, meaning we could be fired for any reason, no notice given. When our school hit a low point with a pretty worthless leader (no knowledge or experience in teaching), people were afraid to stand up to bad policies, lying, manipulation, etc. Morale plummeted, many good people quit. The school almost folded. \n\nAnother, more complicated reason that merit pay does not work in schools, quite aside from morale and collaborative issues, is the simple fact that there are so many VARIABLES in trying to assess different teaching jobs - some subject matter has to necessarily encourage more subjective thinking, such as creative writing, literature, &amp; Art, while higher math needs more abstract thinking, languages require a certain amount of memory work for vocabulary, and on and on.....the work and preparation an individual may put into teaching a class is not always measureable; the kinds of students in the class make a difference, and sometimes it as simple as putting the wrong teacher with the wrong class, which is an administrative issue. \n\nThe worst part of merit pay is that it undermines the qualities of 'true teachers' - those for whom teaching is a calling, those who genuinely want to nurture and care for the next generation because it makes for a better world.",
                "Pretty accurate.  The teachers that I've known were always working their butts off to help their students in any way possible.  Probably the best way that they can actually help improve the education system is if we made sure that we had enough teachers and facilities to lower class sizes to less than 20 kids per class to give them the individual attention that gets results.",
                "(Jim): \"Probably the best way that they can actually help improve the education system is if we made sure that we had enough teachers and facilities to lower class sizes to less than 20 kids per class to give them the individual attention that gets results.\"\nThat reduced class size will enhance system performance is intuitively plausible but unsupported empirically. Furthermore, the \"individual attention\" argument implies subsidized homeschooling, at the limit. Do you expect the NEA to agree to that?  \nThe cartel's dues-generated revenue stream is, in part, a function of he number of teachers. The institutional incentive inclines the system to support smaller classes. This will mean hiring from lower down the list of applicants. Which is better: one 40-student Calc I class taught by a Math PhD or one 20-student Calc  class taught by a Math PhD and one taught by an  M.Ed in Sociology of Education? \n\"What works\" is an empirical question to which an experiment (a competitive market or numerous local policy regimes) will provide more reliable information than will a State-monopoly provider of goods and services.",
                "Even focused attention with some students can only get so far.  There may be external issues a teache no matter the effort cannot overcome to get a student to learn it all.  We have to be able to start at point Z with some ad get as close as we can to G, realizing A is not possible unless circumstances change.  You can lead a horse to water...",
                "It is also unsupported empirically that allowing class sizes to increase would be better for the students.  In fact, there is probably enough evidence out there to suggest that having a class of 25+ students is more detrimental, as a large number of students will just fall through the cracks and be left behind because one teacher can not possibly be able to reach every single student in the exact same way.",
                "Yes, lower class sizes would be the best way to spend our education dollars.  But do you get the impression that Trump or DeVos want to do what would actually work?  There's no reason to think so.\n\nAnd as always, the discussion is made messier and more misleading by ignorant people like Kirkpatrick spouting off as if they knew something.",
                "(Eric): \"... lower class sizes would be the best way to spend our education dollars. (1) .. There's no reason to think ... that Trump or DeVos want to do what would actually work. (2). ...the discussion is made messier and more misleading by ignorant people like Kirkpatrick spouting off as if they knew something .\"(3)\n1. Statistical, empirical research suggests otherwise.  Within reasonable limits, class size reductions DO NOT enhance overall system performance. Perhaps class size reductions make sense in early grades (K-3). As a secondary Math teacher, I would have had no problem with fifty students in an Algebra II class (assuming I can expel behavior problems). Note that Asian counties (Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Singapore)  consistently outperform the US and have larger class sizes.   See TIMSS __Mathematics Achievement in the Middle School Years__.\n2.

Greene's blog: \"Voucher evidence\", \"Charter evidence\" for links to research.  \n3. Eric apparently disagrees with me, but where? If he had a reasonable argument, he would make it, and support it.",

            "body": "BEIJING - China's Foreign Ministry has been at its stonewalling, noncommittal best this week after news of the dramatic assassination of Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of North Korea's leader, repeating the mantra that it has \"noticed relevant media reports and is closely following developments.\" But behind the scenes, there is a sense of shock and dismay in Beijing, officials and experts say: If indeed Kim Jong Nam was assassinated on the orders of the North Korean leader, it would be seen as an affront to the country that has afforded him protection for many years. [Who was Kim Jong Nam?] \"China's inner circle of government is highly nervous about this,\" said Wang Weimin, a professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs at Fudan University in Shanghai. \"Kim Jong Nam's assassination makes China more aware of how unpredictable and cruel the current North Korean regime is, as well as Kim Jong Un's willingness to abandon China and sell it for his own benefit at any second,\" Wang said. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pictured on a South Korean news show about the assassination of his half brother. If North Korea was involved, it would be embarassing for China. (Jeon Heon-Kyun/EPA) Kim Jong Nam had lived for over a decade in Beijing and Macau, apparently with wives and children in both places, and had a reputation as something of a playboy who liked to visit casinos. Chinese experts said he had received 24-hour protection - and monitoring - from China's security services, as well as financial assistance when he needed it. Yet despite his status as the eldest son of former leader Kim Jong Il, he had shown no obvious political ambitions. Wang said that Chinese authorities realized long ago that he lacked leadership potential, and that they did not pin huge hopes on him. Nevertheless, he was a guest of their country, and one who would probably have provided valuable intelligence in the past. The assassination has come at an uncomfortable time for Beijing, just days after North Korea conducted a missile test and when the new Trump administration has been asking China to do more to rein in its troublesome neighbor and ally. [North Korea fires ballistic missile, first since Trump elected in U.S.] China responded to that missile test by asking the United States not to escalate the situation but instead to start a dialogue with Pyongyang. Then, on Monday, Kim Jong Nam apparently was poisoned in an attack by two women at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia. It was a reminder, according to Marcus Noland and Stephan Haggard at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, of the North Korean regime's true nature: \"a cruel and ultimately capricious dictatorship that cannot be trusted on anything,\" the two wrote in a recent essay.  While China's official Communist Party mouthpieces, the People's Daily newspaper and Xinhua News Agency, have confined themselves to bland news reports on the incident, the nationalist Global Times tabloid, given a freer rein, has been more forthright, reflecting views shared by some officials and ordinary citizens. Speculation points sharply at Pyongyang's hand in the murder, in-house commentator Shan Renping wrote Thursday. If that is confirmed, Shan noted, China would join the international community in condemning it. \"Regardless of how intense a country's political struggle might be, there is no doubt that it should never rely on assassination methods as means for its advancement,\" he wrote. \"Human civilization is now in the 21st century, and such a savage and outdated political device should be cast into the museums of history.\" China's critics, however, accuse the country of reaching across borders to kidnap its own dissidents. Relations between Beijing and Pyongyang have deteriorated significantly in recent years. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Kim Jong Un have never met and are believed to share mutual disdain, experts say. [Kim Jong Un is a top suspect in his half brother's death. But questions abound.] In a sign that China's patience might be running out, it rejected a shipment of coal from North Korea on Monday, a day after the ballistic missile test, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported. Fudan University's Wang said China recently received intelligence indicating that some people in North Korean leadership circles have been suggesting sacrificing ties with China and trying to establish closer links with the United States, Japan and South Korea. \"The idea that China cannot be trusted and can only be used, that Japan has been the deadly enemy for hundreds of years but China has been the old enemy for thousands of years - that mentality still prevails in their internal party meetings and was inherited from Kim Jong Un's grandfather,\" he said. In that context, the assassination of Kim Jong Nam could be a signal of the regime's unhappiness with Beijing for supporting United Nations sanctions and of a desire to distance itself from China, he said. Other experts say that it is more likely that Kim Jong Nam was killed by the Southeast Asian underworld, or that - if Pyongyang was responsible - it had more to do with the regime's internal dynamics and paranoia than a desire to send a signal to the world. Nevertheless, as commentator Ding Gang wrote in the Global Times, the development has not made the task of reining in North Korea's nuclear program any easier - and that is not good news for China. \"North Korea's nuclear facilities and missile bases are located near China's border,\" he wrote. \"Once the situation in the Korean Peninsula spirals out of control, the facilities will be primary targets or the final fortress of North Korea's defense. Either way, the effects on China will be severe.\" The murder of Kim Jong Nam, he warned, could reinforce destabilizing calls for tougher action to force \"regime change\" in Pyongyang. \"People in the U.S., Japan and South Korea will more likely opt for hard-line approaches, which will trigger nuclear security problems,\" he wrote. \"We had better prepare for a nuclear emergency in North Korea rather than wasting our time discussing who is behind the assassination.\" Congcong Zhang and Jin Xin contributed to this report.

            "body": "Pedestrians pass by the D.C. restaurant Jaleo, which closed on Feb. 16 for the \"Day Without Immigrants.\" (AFP/Getty/Mandel Ngan) Sergio Roblero didn't need to imagine a \"day without immigrants.\" On Oct. 18 of last year, the 19-year-old line cook lived it. At the time, Roblero -- who is from Chiapas, Mexico - was cooking at a popular Mexican restaurant called Agave in downtown Buffalo. He had overstayed a work visa by several months, he said, but he felt confident that, if he kept his head down, nothing would come of it. But early on the morning of Oct. 18, Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided not only Agave, but three sister establishments. All told, 25 people, including Roblero, were arrested. And of the restaurants targeted in the raid, only one has since reopened. \"Immigrants are part of the U.S. economy,\" Roblero said, in Spanish, via Facebook Messenger. \"Now I'm under house arrest. I haven't left to see any of my coworkers, the restaurant is closed and I can't work.\" Thus far, few restaurants have suffered the scale of the raids that Agave did. But in cities across America, restaurants, bars and hotels are bracing themselves for the possibility of further enforcement action under the Trump administration. On Thursday, restaurants in several major cities - including Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s's Jaleo, Oyamel and Zaytinya in D.C. -- shut down or cut service to demonstrate how much their businesses would suffer without immigrants. Celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, currently locked in a legal battle with President Trump, says he's supporting his immigrant employees taking off from work on Feb. 16 in protest of Trump's immigration stance. (Reuters) It's clear from the data that restaurants depend on undocumented workers for labor. Eleven percent of all U.S. restaurant and bar employees are undocumented immigrants, according to the Pew Research Center. At current industry employment levels, that translates to roughly 1.3 million people. In some places, the numbers are even higher. According to Pew, there are even more undocumented immigrants working restaurant and hospitality jobs in New York, Florida and the Southwest. \"In major cities, you're talking about a restaurant workforce that is maybe 75 percent foreign-born, and maybe 30 to 40 percent undocumented,\" said Saru Jayaraman, a labor activist and the founder of the worker group Restaurant Opportunities Center United. \"The restaurant industry in major cities would absolutely collapse without immigrants.\" Immigrants, particularly undocumented immigrants, aren't always visible to restaurant patrons. They tend to work in lower-level restaurant positions, often in roles that don't involve interacting with customers. Instead, they bus tables, prep food or work the grill line, like Roblero did. According to Pew, undocumented immigrants make up 17 percent of the nation's busboys and 19 percent of its dishwashers. These figures are likely higher in major cities, in states with large numbers of undocumented immigrants, and in certain minority-owned \"ethnic\" food establishments. And they're likely to grow even more in the future. According to a new analysis by Bruce Grindy, the chief economist at the National Restaurant Association, the shrinking population of 16-to-24-year-old workers will further squeeze an industry that has already faced intermittent labor shortages since the end of the recession. Grindy says that restaurants will turn to foreign-born workers to make up the gap. \"Foreign-born employees,\" he writes, \"will be increasingly important to the restaurant industry's ability to expand and create jobs in the years ahead.\" Given these trends, the restaurant industry has long advocated for comprehensive immigration reform - including a \"clear path to legalization\" for undocumented workers. Shortly after the election of President Trump, Jayaraman's group began to hear from restaurants and restaurant workers expressing concern about the president's immigration rhetoric. In response, she partnered with Presente.org, a Latino advocacy group, on an initiative they're calling \"Sanctuary Restaurants\"; among other things, the project offers member restaurants a rapid-response legal hotline and organizing help. In exchange, restaurants publicly post a placard that declares their \"sanctuary\" status.  As of Feb. 16, 400 restaurants had signed up. All of those establishments participated in Thursday's \"Day Without Immigrants,\" Jayaraman said. The national strike sought to show Americans what the dining scene would look like if immigrants, especially undocumented immigrants, could no longer participate. In D.C. at least, a number of restaurants closed their kitchens while leaving the front-of-house open. A trio of pubs owned by restaurateur John Andrade served drinks and let customers bring their own food. At Compass Rose, the entire kitchen staff, save one chef and line cook, are immigrants. Immigrants workers and students went on strike Tuesday to show what a \"Day Without Immigrants\" looks like. Many restaurants, some of which are immigrant-owned, closed in solidarity with the community. (Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post) \"The dining industry would not exist without immigrants. Period,\" said Carlie Steiner, of D.C.'s Himitsu, in a statement. Of course, not everyone agrees that the industry would collapse without undocumented immigrants, even if they play an important role presently. Dan Stein, the president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that staunchly opposes illegal immigration, argues that restaurants could adapt to a crackdown just as easily as they have adapted to other shifts in the labor market. He compares the attitude of restaurateurs who hire undocumented workers to the arguments made in favor of slavery almost 200 years ago: Both systems are exploitative, Stein said, and both claimed that any changes would cause business to suffer. \"Once abolished as a practice, businesses adjust, adopt, shift and innovate,\" Stein told The Post by email. \"The alternative is bankruptcy, and any well-managed business won't go under.\" But in Buffalo, where three popular restaurants remain closed, that doesn't appear to be the case. Of the 25 people arrested in the Oct. 18 raid, three are fighting deportation for overstaying their visas, and five are still in detention, said Brenda Valladares, an organizer for the immigrant rights group Cosecha, which has provided legal and organizational help for the employees. The owner of the restaurants, Sergio Mucino, has also been charged with harboring illegal aliens, as have two of his managers. While Mucino declined via an associate at his remaining restaurant to comment, citing the pending charges, he previously told a reporter that his employees were \"very nice people\" and \"hard workers\" and that he felt \"very bad for everything that happened.\" In the aftermath of the raids, it came out that Homeland Security had targeted Mucino and his restaurants after receiving a tip from a former employee. In a statement, the agency said that \"building and supporting a business through the intentional use of people not lawfully authorized to work here is a model that [Homeland Security] will not tolerate.\" That has been devastating to the families of the employees, Valladares said, particularly those with young children. Many of the families fear being split up if their relatives are deported. They're also having trouble buying food and paying rent while their primary breadwinners await immigration hearings; Cosecha is now providing for many of those needs. Only one of Mucino's restaurants, the taco joint La Divina, is open and in need of employees. On a recent Wednesday evening, the phone at La Divina was answered by a 21-year-old college student named Drew Smith. He was hired after the raids, he said, to replace a cashier who had been arrested, along with several new cooks who, early on, didn't even know where to source ingredients. Smith loves La Divina: The people are nice, the tacos are good, and it \"feels like working in Mexico,\" he said. \"But it seems like less people come to the restaurant now,\" he added. \"I think there's a perception that the tacos are different.\" More from Wonkblog: You could soon pay more money for worse food. Thanks, Donald Trump. If someone doesn't like immigrants, ask them this question Why so many of America's sushi restaurants are owned by Chinese immigrants",

                "For those of you who support illegal immigrants, let me ask you. Is it fair to those who have waited for years and spent tons of money for their citizenship, only to watch illegal immigrants cut in front of them and get microwave citizenship? Why can't they obey the law same as those waiting for their citizenship? They know in advance before coming to America, that there remains the possibility of them getting deported if they are caught. Actions have consequences. Is it fair to the American citizens to be taxed billions of dollars for sanctuary cities citizens? No, it is not when it could all be prevented if immigrants would get their legal documentation. But nooo, they'd rather sneak and cry foul when they get caught. Same as women bringing babies to America for the sole purpose of gaming the system. How is it that they live here for twenty years and never make an attempt to get legal or become an American citizen?",
                "Hi Larry,  \nYou make a valid point.  Why should those that have rightfully and patiently followed the rules suffer when others have \"cut in front\" benefit.  \nWhat is pivotal to understand and that you don't mention is two very important points.  1) These individuals come to the U.S. because they can provide for their family by traveling sometimes thousands of miles and doing generally speaking considered \"undesirable\" jobs by most Americans.  2)  those that are \"illegal immigrants\" should technically be unable to acquire these jobs as they don't have the necessary required information to file taxes.  So, the business that hire them should be accountable as well.  \nTo your last questions about trying to become a legal citizen.  I can't speak from experience as an illegal immigrant but I would hypothesis that they are scared.  These are individuals that know they can be deported.  By acknowledging their situation they put themselves at risk of being deported.  Does that make sense?  \nYou make it all sound so simple, it is not.  To become a citizen requires quite a bit of time and money.  This isn't different from other countries.  \nLastly, this isn't about supporting illegal immigration it is about understanding the economic incentives that create \"illegal migration\".  Can you really blame someone who is willing to potentially travel thousands of miles and perhaps pay someone a large some sum of money to get into the country in hopes of acquiring a job to send money home to their family?",

                "I constantly read about how illegals help our economy. What they are really doing is helping mexico's economy as they send a lot of their income back home to support family members. Not only do they circumvent our laws, thumb their noses at us by not bothering to learn english, but then they send their money to another country. When they don't like it, they then protest against law enforcement.",

It's basically a random draw based on a quota system. first you acquire residency status then put in the paper work, do the requirements and then wait to take a basic civics test. You may become a citizen in less then three years or maybe five. I'm pretty sure it is not a case of walking in saying you want to become a citizen then told to take a number.",

            "body": "Michael Novak, a Catholic philosopher who helped carve a space for religion in modern politics, diplomacy and economics, arguing that capitalism is the economic system most likely to achieve the spiritual goods of defeating poverty and encouraging human creativity, died Feb. 17 at his home in Washington. He was 83. The cause was complications from colon cancer, said his daughter Jana Novak. Mr. Novak, who spent his formative years in the seminary, was widely recognized as one of the most influential Catholic theologians of his generation. He was the 1994 recipient of the Templeton Prize, which honors makers of an \"exceptional contribution to affirming life's spiritual dimension\" and is accompanied by a monetary award exceeding that of the Nobel Prize. In a measure of Mr. Novak's influence within the Catholic Church, he was received and consulted by Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI. He was at times a professor, a columnist, chief U.S. delegate to the U.N. Human Rights Commission and, for several decades, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative think tank in Washington. Mr. Novak was among several scholars who \"brought serious religious thought to Washington in a way that it had not been present before,\" George Weigel, a distinguished senior fellow at the D.C.-based Ethics and Public Policy Center, said in an interview. He credited Mr. Novak with demonstrating to an \"audience of insiders\" a \"way of thinking that was not merely statistical or ideological but was perhaps more deeply reflective of enduring human questions and problems.\" Mr. Novak wrote a shelf full of books on topics ranging from nuclear weapons to atheism to social justice to sports. But he was best known for his economic writings, particularly the book \"The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism\" (1982). \"Democratic capitalism,\" he wrote, is \"neither the Kingdom of God nor without sin. Yet all other known systems of political economy are worse. Such hope as we have for alleviating poverty and for removing oppressive tyranny - perhaps our last, best hope - lies in this much despised system.\" Mr. Novak's book found resonance around the world. It was illegally distributed in Poland, where the Solidarity movement helped defeat communism. His writings were credited with influencing Vaclav Havel, the dissident playwright who became the first president of Czechoslovakia after communism, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain. In affairs across the Atlantic, Mr. Novak was a forceful critic of liberation theology as it was espoused in Latin America, where many adherents argued that the church should provide economic deliverance for the poor through leftist political ideologies. Critics of Mr. Novak charged that he overlooked the severe inequalities often wrought by capitalism: \"Michael Novak preaches capitalism's virtues to Christians,\" Arthur Jones, a columnist for the National Catholic Reporter, once wrote. \"The breakthrough will come when he simultaneously preaches Christian virtues to his capitalist backers.\" Mr. Novak acknowledged that \"Judaism and Christianity do not require democratic capitalism.\" But, he continued, \"it is only that without it they would be poorer and less free.\" In the sphere of international affairs, Mr. Novak tussled with church leaders over Catholic teaching on \"just war.\" He regarded the nuclear deterrent as a moral means of prevailing over the Soviet Union in the Cold War and defeating what Weigel said they and like-minded thinkers considered Communism's \"defective\" and \"downgraded view of the human person.\" It was under President Ronald Reagan that Mr. Novak served on the U.N.'s human rights body. Communism, Weigel said, explaining his and Mr. Novak's position, \"denied that the human person was made in the image and likeness of God, and it's that image in us that is the root, we would argue, of the human dignity from which spring human rights.\" In the cultural arena, Mr. Novak wrote frankly of \"radical feminism, gay liberation, utopian socialism and geopolitical neutralism\" and \"the cheaply radical young graduates of ... Catholic universities.\" But he also drew praise for the openness with which he approached religious dialogue, such as in his book \"No One Sees God: The Dark Night of Atheists and Believers\" (2008). \"The line of belief and unbelief,\" he wrote, \"is not drawn between one person and another, normally, but rather down the inner souls of all of us.\" Michael John Novak Jr. was born to a Slovak American family in Johnstown, Pa., on Sept. 9, 1933. His father was an insurance salesman, and his mother was a homemaker. A brother, Richard Novak, became a priest and was killed amid political upheaval in Bangladesh in 1964. Mr. Novak joined the Congregation of Holy Cross at 14 and studied for the priesthood but ultimately left the order. \"It was not untypical of bright idealistic Catholic boys to want to enter the priesthood, though your immediate circle of friends thought you were faintly crazy,\" Mr. Novak told the New York Times in 1982. He said that he aspired to be a novelist, but \"didn't see how I could do the independent thinking and traveling I wanted to do, and do it in community and under obedience.\" His first book, a novel titled \"The Tiber Was Silver\" (1961), centered on an American seminarian who ventures to Rome and wrestles with the question of whether he can pursue his religious vocation as well as his love of painting. Mr. Novak received a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Stonehill College in Easton, Mass., in 1956, a bachelor of sacred theology degree from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome in 1958 and a master's degree in the history and philosophy of religion from Harvard University in 1966. He positioned himself initially on what he described as the \"anticapitalist left.\" In the early years of his career, he taught at schools including Stanford University, the State University of New York and Syracuse University and did political work for Democrats including Sen. George S. McGovern (S.D.), a torchbearer for liberalism despite his landslide loss to President Richard M. Nixon (R) in 1972. Mr. Novak supported the liberalization of the Catholic Church brought about by the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s - a position he later recanted - and opposed such church teachings as its prohibition on contraception. His early liberal writings included the book \"The Open Church\" (1964), about the effects of Vatican II, and \"A Theology for Radical Politics\" (1969). Over the next several years, Mr. Novak shifted rightward, economically and culturally - an evolution detailed in the memoir \"Writing From Left to Right: My Journey From Liberal to Conservative\" (2013). Contributing to his growing disillusionment with the left was the unsympathetic reception of his book \"The Rise of the Unmeltable Ethnics\" (1972). In that volume, he railed against what he regarded as the marginalization of working-class Eastern European and other ethnic groups by the elite, largely Protestant establishment. In 1978, Mr. Novak joined AEI, where he retired in 2010. He served at the time of his death on the faculty of Catholic University. Mr. Novak's wife of 46 years, the former Karen Laub, died in 2009. Survivors include three children, Richard L. Novak of San Antonio, Tanya Holton of Boston and Jana Novak of Oklahoma City; a sister, Mary Ann Novak of Washington; a brother, Benjamin Novak of Ave Maria, Fla.; and four grandchildren. With his daughter Jana, Mr. Novak wrote \"Tell Me Why: A Father Answers His Daughter's Questions About God\" (1998). In that volume, he articulated his idea of what God is - and is not. \"He is not 'the Big Guy upstairs,' nor the loud booming voice that Hollywood films affect for God ... There are hosts of bogus pictures for God: the Watchmaker beyond the skies, the puppeteer of history,\" he wrote. \"If you wish to find him, watch for him in quiet and humility - perhaps among the poor and broken things of earth. \"There are people,\" he continued, \"who looked into the eyes of the most abandoned of the poor and saw infinite treasure there, treasure without price, and there found God dwelling.\" Read more Washington Post obituaries",

            "body": "President Trump speaks during a news conference Thursday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Mike Dubke, a veteran Republican media strategist, has been hired as the White House communications director, potentially providing some relief for its embattled press secretary, Sean Spicer, who's been holding down both jobs. With the appointment, which a White House official confirmed Friday, President Trump is reaching outside his circle of trusted campaign aides to try to bolster his messaging operation. Dubke is founder of Crossroads Media, an Alexandria-based firm with political and corporate clients. Dubke's hiring could be announced as soon as Friday, according to a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel decision that hasn't been made public. Before taking office, Trump named Jason Miller, a senior campaign and transition aide, to the role of communications director. But Miller stepped aside before Inauguration Day, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. [Trump claims he 'inherited a mess' at sprawling, grievance-filled news conference] Since then, Spicer, the former communications director for the Republican National Committee, has been holding down both jobs, which traditionally have been separate positions. The press secretary is typically the face of the administration, appearing at press briefings, while the communications director engages in longer-term message planning. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and Spicer were involved in hiring Dubke, who is expected to help bring more order to the communications operation. As word of Dubke's hiring trickled out, however, some Trump loyalists chafed at the idea of recruiting an establishment Republican operative with ties to strategist Karl Rove and other forces they see as having been hostile to Trump's candidacy. \"How does this help serve the president's interests?\" asked one Trump insider, who demanded anonymity to speak candidly and claimed to be channeling the views of several others in Trump's orbit. \"It serves the interests of Reince and Sean, but I don't see how it serves the president's interests.\" Dubke has been involved in local, state and federal politics since 1988, according to his biography on the Crossroads Media website. He has also served as co-founder and president of Americans for Job Security, a pro-business advocacy organization.",

            "body": "President Trump repeatedly referenced stolen and leaked information about his political opponents during the 2016 campaign. But now that he's in office, he's a lot less enthusiastic about leaks. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) President Trump was a big fan of leaked - even stolen - information on his campaign rivals during the 2016 election. He called the dump of Clinton campaign emails released by WikiLeaks \"a treasure trove,\" and cited them repeatedly on the campaign trail. And he urged Russia to look for more than 30,000 of Clinton's emails from her private server that were never handed over to the Justice Department in a remarkable news conference in July. But now that he's in office, he's not a fan of leaks at all. It's perhaps an unsurprising turnaround - after all, it was politically convenient to cite WikiLeaks emails during the election, while leaks from within his administration have cast him and his team as incompetent and flailing. Trump says that the leaks coming from his administration are \"illegal\" and \"classified\" in a way the Clinton emails weren't, although whoever hacked into the Clinton campaign's email server surely committed a crime. And many of the leaks coming from the Trump White House aren't exactly \"classified information,\" like the stories of infighting between aides, leaked drafts of executive orders and memos, and potential policies the White House is considering. Trump cited stories about his calls with several world leaders, including the Prime Minister of Australia, as leaks that he wants to investigate - but it's not even clear that information about those calls came from Trump administration sources. And while there's surely an argument to be made about compartmentalizing information that is critical to national security, little such information has made its way to the media so far in his administration. Trump simultaneously claims that the leaks coming out of his administration are \"fake news\" and promises to catch \"criminal leakers,\" which raises a question: Are the leaks \"fake news,\" lacking valuable information, or are they worthy of investigation and possible prosecution? It's a stark but perhaps unsurprising turnaround from someone who used to cite leaked information about his opponents almost daily.",

            "body": "Sam Del Brocco of Alexandria, found slain in Florida in 2010. The man accused of his killing could soon go free. (PCI Communications Inc.) The shocking death of Sam Del Brocco, the Alexandria marketing executive found fatally stabbed in Florida in 2010, took another bizarre turn Thursday when a Broward County judge threw out the murder case against the gay porn star who has been behind bars for three years awaiting trial. Del Brocco, 60, co-owned the prosperous PCI Communications in Alexandria and in 2010 bought an $850,000 townhouse in Pompano Beach. He was found slain there in September 2010, pulling back the curtain on a secret life of gay bars and strippers that his friends in the D.C. area said they were fully unaware of. Though Broward County sheriff's detectives recovered the murder weapon, fingerprints and DNA from the scene, they had no suspects until they connected with John \"Champ\" Snavely, a star of gay porn films and a dancer in gay clubs in the Fort Lauderdale area. Snavely's DNA was on a Coke can in the trash of Del Brocco's apartment and his fingerprints were on the outside of Del Brocco's car. At first, Snavely denied knowing Del Brocco or being in his townhouse. In a second interview, he admitted being in the home but said he and Del Brocco left after about 90 minutes and peacefully parted ways. [Gruesome slaying of executive in 2010 uncovers secret life and leads to arrest, but still no trial] Snavely's defense lawyer, H. Dohn Williams, pointed out that DNA from hair on the knife used to kill Del Brocco was not Snavely's, that DNA on a partially smoked marijuana joint was not Snavely's, that bloody shoe prints in the house did not match Snavely, and that DNA and fingerprints in Del Brocco's car came from someone else. Williams filed a motion to dismiss the case, citing Florida case law which holds that circumstantial evidence cases \"cannot be sustained unless the evidence is inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\" Williams cited the movement of Del Brocco's cell phone to indicate that he went to Fort Lauderdale, then to the Pompano townhouse, then made a second trip to Fort Lauderdale where he may have picked up a second man whose DNA was on the murder weapon. Williams also suggested that Del Brocco was in the process of ending a relationship with a man in Northern Virginia who stood to inherit half of Del Brocco's estate, and that man had a motive to kill Del Brocco. John W. Snavely, charged with the 2010 stabbing death of Sam Del Brocco, could soon be released. (Broward County Sheriff's Office) Broward Circuit Court Judge Ilona M. Holmes held a hearing in December on Williams' motion to dismiss, to which she noted Broward prosecutors did not file a written response. Homes wrote that she was \"mindful that a sworn motion to dismiss should rarely be granted and granted only when the facts and inferences...do not establish a prima facie [\"on its face\"] case.\" Though courts in many states might allow prosecutors to at least present the evidence to a jury, Florida allows its judges to take a hard look at a case before trial. And for the murder charge against Snavely, Holmes concluded, \"This evidence is not enough.\" She noted that \"there are no eyewitnesses to the crime, the murder weapon was recovered with someone else's hair and DNA on it. Shoe prints with victim's blood were never matched to this defendant. Defendant has never confessed to committing this crime and no one has come forward attesting to any suspicious activity on Defendant's part.\" In addition to Snavely's DNA on the Coke can and his fingerprints on the outside of Del Brocco's car, Broward assistant state's attorney Will Sinclair pointed to the video of detectives interviewing Snavely in July 2013 where he exhibited \"fits of rage,\" and that Del Brocco's gruesome murder was \"a crime of rage.\" Holmes said she could not \"infer defendant's guilt by his demeanor at the end of the four-hour DVD of his interview with the police.\" [Man arrested in Alexandria businessman's killing] Florida defense attorney H. Dohn Williams successfully argued the motion that could free the man accused of killing Sam Del Brocco. (H. Dohn Williams) In dismissing the case Thursday, Holmes gave Broward prosecutors 15 days to appeal. Sinclair did not return calls seeking comment. Snavely remains in the Broward County jail. Williams said Friday that \"I think it's obvious by Mr. Del Brocco's movements that night, he had two visitors. John Snavely had admitted being a visitor, but not the last visitor.\" He said that \"the incriminating evidence against him is in the garbage can in the kitchen,\" and that Del Brocco was \"a neat freak. I can see the Coke can being immediately put away, and if you look at the crime scene photos, after the second visitor there are two bottles on the kitchen counter, and the marijuana cigarette in the bedroom. And of course, there's the unexplained DNA on the murder weapon.\" Williams said it took three years to get to the dismissal stage because Snavely's previous lawyers had not spent much time critically analyzing the evidence, and that when he took over the case there were further delays because he had other murder cases to try. He said he did not know whether Broward prosecutors would appeal, but \"I'm hoping they don't. Theoretically they could, but they have to ask themselves, 'Do we really have a probable likelihood of a conviction?'\"",

Snavely should never have been charged, much less spent 3 years rotting away in jail.\n\nIt seems pretty obvious that the police and prosecutors were blinded by their prejudices against gay porn stars in charging this guy.\n\nIt is also notable that the prosecutors didn't even try to rebut the motion to dismiss.  THAT certainly tells you how weak their case was.  Given the weakness of the case and the prior Florida Supreme Court precedent this case was a sure loser from day one.  They were obviously trying to pressure Snavely into taking a plea deal, knowing they couldn't win at trial.  This case is further evidence of how broken our so-called 'criminal justice' system has become.\n\nThis case helps complete our understanding of Florida.

            "body": "If and when Kirk Cousins signs a long-term contract with the Redskins this offseason, the quarterback may have a new catchphrase at the ready, assuming he's perfected it by then. During his week in Houston ahead of this year's Super Bowl, Cousins spent some time with Frisbee trick shot artist Brodie Smith. They filmed a video on behalf of Visa in which they took turns throwing footballs and Frisbees through hula hoops that had been tossed in the air, trick shots that were reminiscent of the Precision Passing mini-camp drill in old versions of EA Sports' \"Madden\" video game. [If the Redskins part with Kirk Cousins, here are three options at quarterback] Afterward, while discussing Cousins's catchphrases over the past two seasons, the quarterback revealed he has a new one \"in the shop.\" \"I've been known to say 'You Like That,' Cousins told Smith. \"You know, 'You Like That!' Or, 'Ooooooweeee.' Or even the latest one was, 'How you like me now?!' But one I've been working on, it's in the shop right now, this is the first time anyone is going to see it, give 'em a little BINGO! BANGO! BONGO! BAZINGA!\" Cousins stood up and punctuated his (potentially) \"Big Bang Theory\"-inspired new celebration with a Gronk Spike. Now, part of the beauty of Cousins's previous displays of emotion is that they were unexpected and seemingly spontaneous. \"It's just organic, it's natural out of the emotion coming off of a big win,\" Cousins said in November of his 'How you like me now?!' moment with GM Scot McCloughan. \"That's what comes out, just like 'You like that?' or any of the other stuff that's been put out there.\" The best catchphrases aren't workshopped. This is sort of like Lacey Chabert's character in \"Mean Girls\" trying to make \"Fetch\" happen. Still, it would be something to see Cousins break out \"BINGO! BANGO! BONGO! BAZINGA!\" after threading the needle in practice, finishing his next good book or signing with the Redskins. The catchphrase talk begins around the 1:10 mark of the video below.

In the video, the squirrel stops for a moment to look at Curtius before running away.

They're fairly rare but not unheard of. White and albino squirrels can be easy for predators to catch. Unlike their white squirrel relatives, albino squirrels have pink eyes. Alonso Abugattas, the natural resources manager for Arlington's Parks and Recreation Department, said seeing albino or white squirrels in that area is rare. Still, a website called \"Untamed Science,\" run by Rob Nelson, an ecologist from the University of Hawaii, says white squirrels sightings aren't all that uncommon in the Washington region. [Albino squirrels are rare, but here's one spotted in Arlington] Apparently the white nut-gatherers are common enough in some places that some towns claim to be the \"White Squirrel Capital of the World,\" including Olney, Ill., population of roughly 8,600.

Other cities that claim to have large white squirrel populations include Kenton, Tenn., and Brevard, N.C., according to roadsideamerica.com. Given that the white squirrel she spotted doesn't camouflage well, Curtius said, \"who knows how long it will last?\" There's been \"no snow to hide him,\" she said, but the squirrel did look fat and healthy. \"I think he's beautiful,\" she said.",

(Jackie Battenfield/Addison/Ripley Fine Art) Spring has arrived early in area galleries, which are budding with floral imagery. Not all of it is soft and delicate. The majority of the works in Addison/Ripley Fine Art's \"Branched\" is by Julia Bloom, who arranges bare twigs into latticelike forms. These are the inspiration for her charcoal drawings, some of which climb higher than the sculptures. Julia Bloom's \"Clear Forest #5,\" at Addison/Ripley Fine Art. (Julia Bloom/Addison/Ripley Fine Art) The D.C. artist's model is the forest, where trees divide space, diffuse light and cast shifting shadows. Yet Bloom's wired-together constructions can resemble buildings as much as baskets or birdcages, and are sometimes painted in bright, artificial colors. \"Clear Forest #5 Gray\" is a leaning tower of sorts, and most of the sticks in the wall-mounted \"Abacus\" are vivid blue. Although Bloom's drawings essentially depict her sculptures, they have a different feel. The hard edges are sometimes softened by smeary grays, and perspective deftly simulates the dimensions of the twig-built grids. The seven-foot-high \"Monolith 3\" evokes misty depths with gray-on-gray gestures and has nearly the presence of a 3-D piece. \"Branched\" also features Jackie Battenfield's paintings, in which silhouetted trunks and twigs are embellished by leaves and flowers. From a distance, these vignettes appear realistic. But the New York artist paints with watery acrylics on Mylar panel, so the pigment flows and pools, and yields accidental patterns when it dries. Usually executed in just two or three colors, Battenfield's pictures are part minimalist and part abstract. And yet they convey nature's serene aspects.

Kiki McGrath & Jean Jinho Kim Swirls of green suggest the botanical origins of Kiki McGrath's expressionist abstractions, but the local artist also has drawn on another source, examples of which are part of this Studio Gallery show. Alongside the paintings, \"Aerial Roots\" displays three sculptures inspired by ikebana - Japanese flower-arranging - and made by local devotees of the art form. These are large, burly and far from traditional. Rather than dainty flowers and grasses, the assemblages feature log-size branches and unnatural accents; one incorporates chunks of vine painted orange. With them, McGrath has installed a black rubber hose, coiled and hanging in midair. The shape of this gardening accessory echoes the spirals in the paintings and pays an amusing tribute to ikebana. The found-object sculpture is not flower-arranging, but it is an act of transformation, and that's an fundamental theme of Japanese art. Downstairs, Jean Jinho Kim has clustered everyday objects in ways that complement \"Aerial Roots.\" The Leesburg artist's \"No Boundaries\" is more far-ranging, but it does include glittering mock butterflies and - in a piece titled \"Garden 1 60-12\" - two roselike blooms. If Kim's assemblages include many industrial materials, there is a hint of ikebana amid the car parts and LEDs.

Wendy Cortesi's drawing \"Veronica,\" at Adah Rose Gallery. (Wendy Cortesi/Adah Rose Gallery) Botanical illustration is such a specific calling that the Corcoran used to award a certificate in it. The 11 artists in Adah Rose Gallery's current show, members of the local Studio 155 cooperative, all participated in that program. The paintings and drawings in \"These Flowers Are Like the Pleasures of the World,\" do include a few non-vegetal subjects, ranging from small (snails) to vast (the Grand Canyon). But most depict flowers, fruits and vegetables with academic precision. Indeed, among the drawings are Wendy W. Cortesi's \"process\" pieces, which catalogue the visual and scientific aspects of plants she's preparing to render in watercolor. Other artists add drama with black backdrops, giving their paintings an Old Master vibe, or with implied action; Donald Beekman Myer pictures fruit such as lemons and pears, tumbling like dice. Most ominous is Roberta Matthews Bernstein's series on toxic plants, pretty but potentially fatal. The skull and crossbones painted on the side of one canvas warn that botanical art is not for the timid.

Ott \"Metallics,\" the title of Mary D. Ott's show at Touchstone Gallery, refers to her use of gold, silver and copper paint and ink. But the subject of the Silver Spring artist's paintings and prints is not metal but grass, a longtime interest. Wispy blades are conjured with embroidery yarn dipped into pigment to produce hundreds of lines, usually vertical. The resulting image could be an unmown lawn, a wild prairie or merely an exercise in color and form. Mary D. Ott's \"Copper I,\" at Touchstone Gallery, in which wispy blades are conjured with embroidery yarn dipped into pigment. (Mary D. Ott/Touchstone Gallery) The metallic hues give the paintings an undulating glow that suggests daybreak or sunset. The prints lack that luminosity, but they're just as compelling. Ott uses string much as she does thread in the paintings, drawing lines on a plate that's then etched. The elegant \"Wide Grass\" series renders meadows in blue and silver, and \"Grass Bouquet VI\" contrasts lacy, detailed fronds in black with looser shapes in reddish brown. This is the meadow as a minimalist Eden, a place of narrow yet infinite variety. Metallics: Paintings and Prints by Mary D.

(Blaise Tobia/Hillyer Art Space) Blaise Tobia Among some stern sects, austerity is required in public only. Opening the door to a private space reveals that different rules apply. That's true, Blaise Tobia's \"Plain & Fancy\" demonstrates, even of such seemingly utilitarian objects as the horse-drawn carriages of Pennsylvania's Amish. Inside the stark black or gray exteriors are bright colors, textured carpet and other unexpected decorative touches. The Hillyer Art Space show consists of twinned photos of in and out, both in close-up. Tobia made the images, but the Philadelphia artist doesn't consider himself primarily a photographer. He's concerned more with contrasting found forms than with documentary storytelling (although he does allow glimpses of Amish life, visible in the background or reflected in windows). Although the backstory is intriguing, the diptychs would work even if their subject were unknown. The juxtaposition of asceticism and flamboyance reflects human contradictions far beyond Lancaster County. Blaise Tobia: Plain & Fancy On view through Feb. 26 at Hillyer Art Space, 9 Hillyer Ct.

            "body": "So many signatures, and so nicely presented. (Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty images) The three-way race to host the 2024 Summer Olympics could shrink by one after a petition campaign in Budapest will put that city's candidacy up for a vote. As reported by Vice, a group called NOlimpia has collected enough signatures - 266,151 of them - over the past month to force the Olympic-hosting question onto a ballot referendum. And even if 20 to 25 percent of those signatures are invalidated, as NOlimpia expects they will be, there still will be plenty of wiggle room between the number of valid signatures and the 138,000 needed to get the measure onto the ballot. A recent poll found 44 percent of Hungarians are against the Olympic bid, with only 25 percent supporting it and the rest undecided, Vice notes. NOlimpia says the money earmarked for the Olympics should instead be spent on things such as health care, education and rural infrastructure. Budapest is the third city to drop out of the running for the 2024 Olympics after Rome and Hamburg, where 51.6 percent voted against a bid in a 2015 referendum. Left standing are Los Angeles and Paris, with both saying they will rely upon existing infrastructure instead of spending wildly on new construction. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach has said that the Olympic bidding process needs to change after a number of prospective hosts balked at the cost, ending their own bids after losing support of their citizens. \"You can see how in many countries, you have populist movements and anti-establishment movements getting stronger and stronger, asking different and new questions,\" he said in December. NOlimpia spokesman Daniel Corsano said his movement is one such example. \"The IOC prescribes wide-ranging support for bids to host the Olympics, I think we have showed it that this does not exist in Budapest,\" he wrote in email to Vice. \"We expect them, and the government, to act accordingly.\" The IOC will announce the 2024 winner at a September meeting in Peru. According to reports, Bach and other Olympic officials are privately mulling a plan to hand out both the 2024 and the 2028 Games at that meeting, with Paris getting one of them and Los Angeles the other. This would at least temporarily fend off the further embarrassment that arises when cities drop out of the running, award future Olympics to two cities that for now would welcome the Games and give the IOC time to formulate a new bidding and hosting process, one that ideally lessens the financial impact on host cities.",

                "The Olympics movement is so corrupted by money and power that it taints everything it touches.  There should be a permanent location so they can build one set of buildings and maintain them.  Instead as in Sarajevo, Sochi, and now Rio, land is taken from people to build venues that are soon abandoned.  No permanent infrastructure that benefits the actual people who live in the host cities is left behind.  In fact, the local population is often displaced so the venues can be built.  And think of Sochi, in one of the most temperate areas of Russia, being artificially turned into a winter site!  How could the competition areas ever be used again when there's usually no snow and they had to import it!  I'm tired of the Olympics and what it does to the communities that are forced to host.  Two weeks of athletic and cultural splendor so the bigwigs can line their pockets.  The idea that they can move it somewhere else next time just opens up another window for graft.  A permanent location would limit the graft!",
                "Few cities benefit from holding an Olympics. A movement which, at the top, has a lot of corruption issues. \n\nI'm not in favor of ending the Olympics, but there is need for a lot of soul-searching regarding the movement's future. And a need for less pocket-lining at the expense of those who aren't able to afford it.",

According to Vogue he's an \"emerging journalistic hero.\" Watch \"Saturday Night Live\" and the veteran newsman becomes Kellyanne Conway's greatest foil. Head to Barnes & Noble next summer and you'll find Tapper in the fiction aisle. Wait, what? \"I started thinking about the book and developing the plot years ago,\" Tapper told us via email after news of his debut novel, \"The Hellfire Club,\" broke earlier this week. \"After several false starts,\" according to Tapper, he started writing the book last year, around the same time his day job got busier with one of the most unprecedented presidential elections in U.S. history. That's right. Tapper, who anchors CNN's \"The Lead\" and serves as the cable network's chief Washington correspondent, has written a fictional tale covering shady politics, backroom deals and crime set smack dab in the \"swamp\" he covers on a daily basis. But if the topic sounds familiar, the timeline might not: \"The Hellfire Club\" is set in 1954. \"The process could not be more different than my work as an anchor and journalist at CNN,\" Tapper explained. \"The Trump administration and the environment in Washington for months now has provided a fire hose of news,\" he said. \"Writing and crafting this novel ... is a much more delicate and careful process, and thankfully I have more control over developments in the book.\" So replace the current cast of the Real Politicians of Washington - President Trump, Stephen K. Bannon and Conway - with President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Sen. Joe McCarthy (R-Wis.), then-Sen. John F. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and then-Vice President Richard Nixon. Well, that nixes at least one of D.C. insiders' favorite literary pastimes - thumbing through books looking for thinly veiled references to friends and frenemies. Tapper explained that \"it's not as though anyone will see people they know disguised as various characters.\" But this town's particular quirks - money, power, respect - remain the same. Whether the current (and seemingly never-ending) spotlight on the District's marbled halls of power will make \"The Hellfire Club\" a must read next summer is still anyone's guess. Although Tapper admitted the interest in Washington these days is new. \"People are engaged in politics in a way I've never seen before,\" he said. \"Though, to be fair, to Washington it was far more swampy in the 1950s.\"",

There was stuff going on in Washington, nefarious characters everywhere, and the Russians were in their hey day too.   Spy ships off the New England coast--- really!   At that time Cleveland was literally surrounded by Nike missiles, aimed (presumeably) at Russia.   The newspapers let us know about it, too, and we were all duly scared to death.

            "body": "First the National Parks went rogue, sharing climate change data on Twitter. Now museums and libraries have taken up arms - or at least typing fingers - to fight on behalf of facts. Using the hashtag #DayofFacts, more than 280 scientific and cultural institutions are devoting Friday to dropping 140-character truths on Twitter. Many of the facts seem pointedly political - like the National Museum of American Jewish History's tweet about a George Washington letter affirming religious freedom in the country, or a placard held up in a video by Chicago's Field Museum that stated \"Climate change is accelerating the extinction of plants and animals.\" The political undertone is the goal, according to Alli Hartley, a museum educator from Virginia who helped organize the campaign with her colleague Mara Kurlandsky. \"We're using facts to illustrate truth about the present moment,\" Hartley said.

The National Park Service Twitter account had been temporarily shut down after it retweeted an image comparing inauguration crowd sizes. Then senior adviser Kellyanne Conway tried to explain the dust-up over the attendance by saying the administration had \"alternative facts.\" Then an ex-employee at Badlands National Park briefly took control of the park's twitter account to fire off a series of factual tweets about climate change. The missives were quickly deleted, but other parks (and a cadre of \"alt\" twitter accounts) took up the cause. That's when Hartley saw a post from Death Valley National Park noting that the park had hosted interned Japanese Americans during World War II. During WWII Death Valley hosted 65 endangered internees after the #Manzanar Riot. #JapaneseAmericanInternment - Death Valley NP (@DeathValleyNPS) January 25, 2017 \"I thought it was brilliant in that there was no way an administration or anyone could question it, because on one level it wasn't political, it was just sharing factual content. But on another level it really resonated with the political moment,\" she said. She reached out to Kurlandsky, who oversees digital engagement for the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, and asked for help organizing a social media campaign. Pretty soon they had a website, a twitter handle and a following that included the Newseum, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, the National Aquarium, even the Encyclopaedia Britannica, along with dozens of smaller museums and public libraries nationwide and even worldwide. \"Given the political discourse and discussion about alternative facts and fake news, it's important for museums to remind people ... we're here as trusted sources of information and facts are important and truth is important,\" Hartley said.  She and her colleagues were wary about calling the Day of Facts a form of \"resistance.\" Most museums rely partly on grants from federal agencies like the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, and neighborhood libraries depend almost entirely on public dollars. They don't want to put their funding at risk by running afoul of public officials. (This is why Hartley, who works for a public park system, asked that her employer not be named.)

(Left and right, Jonas Gustavsson; center, Marcelo Soubhia; MCV Photo for The Washington Post) NEW YORK - The last show here for the fall 2017 season was mounted Thursday afternoon by Marc Jacobs and was inspired by hip-hop. Jacobs saw the documentary \"Hip-hop Evolution\" several months ago, and it made him nostalgic for his high school years in New York - when rap was emerging as popular music, a new fashion aesthetic was being created, and the definition of Americana was shifting. His stripped-down production began at the stroke of the hour, when a single model began her walk across the cracked wooden floor of the Park Avenue Armory. There was no elaborate set design. In fact, there was no set at all. There were just two long rows of chairs lined up facing each other, only 326 in total. There was no music. The models walked in silence, without even the soft clicks of cameras -photographers were asked to wait outside to capture the models as they emerged. It was a gorgeous and wondrous 10 minutes. Marc Jacobs fall/winter 2017 collection (Jonas Gustavsson/MCV Photo for The Washington Post) Marc Jacobs fall/winter 2017 collection (Jonas Gustavsson/MCV Photo for The Washington Post) Marc Jacobs fall/winter 2017 collection (Jonas Gustavsson/MCV Photo for The Washington Post) Marc Jacobs fall/winter 2017 collection (Jonas Gustavsson/MCV Photo for The Washington Post) That's how long it took for the women to saunter down the runway with their woven coats with furry collars, their gold sequined minis, flared trousers, throwback sweat suits, huge platform boots, giant gold hoop earrings and Stephen Jones-designed takes on Kangol caps. It was a diverse cast of models walking in this show with its late '70s/early '80s retro vibe. They evoked a stylish, city girl look from the time before hip-hop turned ghetto fabulous and triggered an arms race for Gucci and Louis Vuitton. There was more style back then than fashion - at least the kind that came with fancy French and Italian labels. The collection didn't reproduce the clothes of the era. Jacobs isn't doing hip-hop, per se. This was that time period as seen through the eyes of Jacobs, a New York City kid attending the High School of Art and Design. It was his memory - both accurate and false. Or, as he put it in the show notes, \"an acknowledgement and gesture of my respect for the polish and consideration applied to fashion from a generation that will forever be the foundation of youth culture street style.\" Marc Jacobs fall/winter 2017 collection (Stefan Knauer/MCV Photo for The Washington Post) Marc Jacobs fall/winter 2017 collection (Stefan Knauer/MCV Photo for The Washington Post) Marc Jacobs fall/winter 2017 collection (Stefan Knauer/MCV Photo for The Washington Post)   Marc Jacobs fall/winter 2017 collection (Stefan Knauer/MCV Photo for The Washington Post) Marc Jacobs fall/winter 2017 collection (Stefan Knauer/MCV Photo for The Washington Post) With this collection, Jacobs dove headlong into the murky waters of cultural appropriation, a phrase used here with some trepidation. American popular culture, after all, does not exist in hermetically sealed bubbles. Forms of dress and music spring up because of cross-fertilization. Sometimes styles are born in direct opposition to another. But last season, Jacobs caused consternation with his use of multi-colored wool dreadlocks on the runway. His beauty team said the inspiration was punk and Boy George, among other things. But no where in that mix did they mention black people. And that omission caused outrage. [The uproar over Marc Jacobs and dreadlocks is ridiculous] Typically, Jacobs does not leave mission statements for his audience. So the inclusion of an insert explaining the source of his inspiration, a page headlined \"Respect,\" was an exception and served as a direct rebuke to those guardians of culture who would stand ready to call him disrespectful. But there was no need for a statement: There was beauty and sophistication in this collection. There was humor. The collection wasn't a caricature. And it wasn't mocking. If anything, it struck a note of awe. Marc Jacobs fall/winter 2017 collection (Jonas Gustavsson/MCV Photo for The Washington Post) Jacobs served as a fine finish to the season here, with a collection that was deeply American in a manner that felt vibrant and particularly relevant. Hip-hop, after all, was nurtured in urban centers by black and brown youths. It spoke of ingenuity, ambition, protest and confidence. Now, of course, it is a global language - one that speaks just as profoundly to immigrants in the suburbs of Paris as it does to ambitious, middle-class young men recording mix tapes. Ralph Lauren, with its enormous cultural footprint, speaks of a different vision of America. There is nothing messy, tumultuous, tacky or ugly in his version. He presented what he calls his February 2017 collection. In September, Lauren turned fashion's seasonal calendar upside down when he decided to present a see-now/buy-now show. So the clothes that he put on the runway Wednesday evening are now available for purchase in various flagship stores and online. Ralph Lauren fall/winter 2017 collection. (Marcelo Soubhia/MCV Photo for The Washington Post) He presented the collection in his Madison Avenue store where the walls were covered in thousands of white orchids and the sound of chirping birds greeted guests. The collection was filled with ethereal caftans, sparkling gold dresses, motocross leather leggings, distressed leather jackets and evening gowns with geometric cut-outs. Ralph Lauren fall/winter 2017 collection. (Marcelo Soubhia/MCV Photo for The Washington Post) The collection was tasteful and restrained. Some of it was beautiful, especially a simple, gold silk caftan-style evening gown. But much of it was flat. Cold. Rote. The clothes could have been from five years ago or 10. In part, that is because Lauren is a classicist. He works within a vocabulary that he established decades ago. It defines his brand; it has built his legacy; it's what customers understand. But Lauren has not used that powerful vocabulary to speak to the moment, to the right-now. This is not a plea for Lauren to be political or to dive into some social issue. But while the brand is fretting about when exactly its merchandise should turn up in stores, it doesn't seem to giving the same urgent attention to what is on the runway. [Melania Trump picks patriotism and international glamour for her debut as first lady] The clothes weren't fanciful enough to be transporting. And they weren't real enough to be soulful. They seemed detached. Do people wear leather motocross pants? Does a woman want silk britches? Maybe. But it will take some convincing, and Lauren doesn't make much of a case. It is as though his name on the label should be convincing enough. Ralph Lauren fall/winter 2017 collection. (Marcelo Soubhia/MCV Photo for The Washington Post) Ralph Lauren fall/winter 2017 collection. (Marcelo Soubhia/MCV Photo for The Washington Post) Clothes don't have to have a message. They don't need to come with a story attached. But what gives them a vibrancy are the details and flourishes from a designer who is forever curious - listening to new music, attending the reading of a new author, taking in an artful film. That awareness comes through the clothes in subtle ways. The collection that Lauren presented looked as though it was sketched in a soundproof room. Mostly, though, this was a raucous season for women's fashion. There were countless expressions of displeasure with the Trump administration and exhortations for female power, immigrant rights and human rights, in general. The designer Sophie Theallet, who took an early stand against dressing the first lady, created a collection of printed dresses and multi-textured evening gowns that through their silhouettes and proportions are meant to serve as a kind of protective armor. She also included embellishments of bees - a symbol of femininity, Theallet said during a presentation at her showroom. And so the abundance of bees \"represents an army of women.\" Bee details on evening gown by Sophie Theallet for fall/winter 2017. (Robin Givhan/The Washington Post) Other designers had nothing to say politically - at least not publicly. They simply created collections that elevated the needs of professional women. Victoria Beckham offered beautiful printed dresses and tailored blazers. And Gabriela Hearst, in her first formal show, exhibited a keen eye for a sleek overcoat and the kind of woolen separates that a woman could wear into the boardroom. Narciso Rodriguez offered distinct ideas on female power dressing, too. He likes lean trousers in black or bold colors paired with streamlined leather tops. In short, ladies, there are professional alternatives; you can give those sleeveless sheaths a rest. Victoria Beckham fall/winter 2017 collection.

It afforded him the opportunity to answer questions and gave his audience a chance to really see this clothes and not just glimpse them as a model rushed by. His trousers with double layers of light, contrasting fabric looked as comfortable as pajamas, but a lot more stylish. He also favored high-waisted, full pants and luxurious blouses. Lam also has a knack for a head-turning coat - and his black and white, dyed-mink coat could make one long for a polar vortex.

Crew fall/winter 2017 collection (Ze Takahashi/MCV Photo for The Washington Post) If there was any thread that connected the collections for fall, it was the question of what it means to be a U.S. designer. How do you speak your mind? How do you represent America in this moment? In the aftermath of the Women's March, how do you create fashion that speaks to women's desires and needs? What comes after pink pussy hats? This was a season in which women of all color walked the runways. So did women wearing hijabs, as well as plus-size women, older models and women who are not professional models at all. Female poets recited quartets; female protesters raised their voices; and designers spoke up about everything from human rights to the humanity of the American story in all of its windswept, Midwestern glory.

There were fanciful handbags, metallic fabrics and sexy, high-heeled pumps. For fall 2017, Seventh Avenue reflected the times. And still managed to give us fashion.

            "body": "I spend a lot of time coaching people about money management. Without a doubt, the saddest sessions - the ones that draw the most tears - are when people are fighting with family about finances. The combat can get particularly nasty when it involves siblings, who seem to know just the right insults to hurt deeply. And can I be honest? Many of these arguments are the result of parents stoking rivalries or playing favorites, particularly to irresponsible adult children. Or a parent will tell one child one thing and another something different. Sometimes it's to keep the peace among warring adult children, but other times it's a conscious act to deceive. I've opened up an avenue for readers to ask my opinion about family financial feuds. In this regular feature, I try to provide some clarity by sharing how I see the situation. Sometimes it helps to get an outsider's viewpoint. I recently heard from a reader who is upset about parental support that a sibling is receiving. [Family fraud: Would you press charges against your baby?] The background: The reader's sister, who is 30, has received substantial financial assistance from the parents her entire adult life. They were paying her rent at one time, and now she lives in their basement. The woman's unemployed boyfriend is also staying there and has been for about nine months - including during a period when they were broken up. The reader feels alone among her family in being upset about how the parents have supported the sister. The battle: \"Not to get into any emotional issues,\" the reader said, \"I want to know why I am the only one [in the family] to find a problem with [the boyfriend] living off of my parents as well. Even when they broke up, he moved to a different room but still paid no rent and had no job. No, actually he'd [gotten] a job but had to quit after a week because he thought construction work was too hard. My parents think they're helping someone who is down on his luck. They also paid to get his car fixed and all his insurance and gas money. Why am I the only one who doesn't trust him?\" The bottom line: I'd like to unwrap this as best I can without additional information. (People don't always give me all the facts.) [How to keep your cash from leaving the nest when your kids do] Let's start with the rent. A lot of young adults have trouble making ends meet. They may be underemployed, carrying student loan debt or both. So I'm not opposed to parents chipping in to help an adult child starting out. But parents have to distinguish between help and a handout to someone who isn't trying his or her best to be independent. I'm particularly concerned about parents who are retired and digging into limited retirement funds to help an irresponsible adult stay that way. You are doing your child a disservice - and really, you aren't being a good parent when you enable poor behavior. If the spigot is never turned off, it will run dry. Then what? How have you helped your child learn to survive? Regarding the reader's sister moving back in with her folks, I'm not opposed to that, either. My husband and I have told our children that they are welcome to return home after college to save and prepare themselves to live on their own. In fact, we encourage it. Our older daughter is about to graduate from college (yeah!) and she's going straight to graduate school. We've told her that after she finishes her education, she should come home. We want her to save the money she would pay for rent for a few years so that once she launches, she'll have a fully funded emergency pot or even money for a down payment on a home of her own. And I'll add this: I'm a fan of multigenerational or shared housing. In many high-cost areas, it's hard for families to afford rent or a house. Shared living space is one solution to this problem. Now as to the boyfriend: It wouldn't happen if it were my house. The parents are not responsible for supporting this grown man, who is not married to their daughter - and who appears to have no work ethic. Please. Finally, as for my reader, I understand the concern. Who wants to see their parents taking care of a trifling adult child? But in this case, if the parents are being taken advantage of, it's by their choice. And if this is about the sister getting more than she deserves, let it go. It's not your money.

(Matthew Emmons/USA TODAY Sports) For the second year in a row, Terrell Owens was denied a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and while he's long maintained he doesn't care whether he's inducted, he does take issue with the those who blame his bad reputation for keeping him out. Because, ahem, also for the second year in a row, he's taken aim at Hall of Famer Cris Carter, whom Owens said has referred to him as \"a flawed candidate.\" [T.O. isn't in the Hall of Fame yet for a pretty silly reason] \"Don't throw stones when you live in a glass house,\" Owens said recently on WFAN with Mike Francesa (via CBS New York). \"He wants me to wait because he had to wait. I did more with less. I was better than Cris Carter. So he shouldn't mention anything about anybody, especially me, about being a flawed candidate when here's a guy who got released, flunked three drug tests from Philly - cocaine and alcohol addiction - and then there was somewhere down the road he's telling guys to ask somebody to be a fall guy. What kind of character is that? So c'mon man. C'mon.\" Owens, of course, was referring to advice Carter gave to NFL rookies in 2014 when he urged them to keep a \"fall guy\" around to take the blame should they be implicated in any sort of untoward or even criminal behavior. (Carter, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2013, apologized for his remarks on live television the following year.) [T.O. misses out on Pro Football Hall of Fame, calls voting a 'flawed process'] Owens took similar jabs at Carter last February when he said Carter \"begged his way into the Hall of Fame.\" Statistically speaking, Owens deserves a spot. The 43-year-old former wide receiver ranks eighth all-time in receptions with 1,078, second in receiving yards with 15,934 and third in receiving touchdowns with 153. The 51-year-old Carter meanwhile, ranks fifth all-time in receptions with 1,101, 13th in receiving yards with 13,899 and fourth in receiving touchdowns with 130.",

            "body": "Donovan Mitchell is one of the players upholding Louisville's trademark defense. (Mark Konezny/USA Today Sports) The overarching identity of Louisville basketball - well, 21st century Louisville basketball - is obvious enough. It's Rick Pitino, still prowling the sidelines into his mid-60s. (And did you know his 16 seasons at Louisville matches his combined total of years with Providence, the New York Knicks, Kentucky and the Boston Celtics?) By extension, the Cardinals' identity is ferocious defense. Annually, it winds up among the most miserly in the land. Usually, it features strength in numbers. Occasionally, there's a charismatic offensive star who can turn a really good team into a true national title contender. Louisville checks all of those boxes this season, yet the Cardinals aren't quite as popular in the national title discussion as some other programs. Villanova won it last year. Kansas is loaded (again). Kentucky and Duke are both stocked with young talent and included in such conversations by reflex. Gonzaga is undefeated. [At Duke, Grayson Allen is as loved as ever and a bumpy season is taking off] Meanwhile, the Cardinals are 21-5, lead the country in defensive efficiency according to KenPom.com and own the country's best three-point percentage defense. Their coach has six Sweet 16s, five Elite Eights, two Final Fours and a national title in his last eight trips to the tournament. Louisville understands the formula for postseason success, and this group is equipped to follow it. This is not to say the Cardinals are completely overlooked. But there are some reasons this particular edition of Louisville hasn't quite captured imaginations like in past years. [Bracketology: Bubble teams still have time to cover their warts] Unheralded players. It was really easy to forget about Louisville last year once it self-imposed an NCAA tournament ban. But even if the school's administration hadn't sacrificed a postseason to Pitino's quite public dismay, the Cardinals had the roster of a team in transition. Damion Lee and Trey Lewis, a pair of graduate transfers, were the upperclassman anchors. It was otherwise almost entirely a group of freshmen and sophomores who figured to bloom into the nucleus of Louisville's next great run. That's come to pass, though only sophomore Donovan Mitchell (team-high 15.2 points per game) and perhaps junior Quentin Snider have become easily recognized names. Mitchell proved especially valuable as a fill-in point guard when Snider missed six games with hip injury in the middle of league play. There's no shortage of options to take a star turn, with Deng Adel and Jaylen Johnson among them. In Monday's victory at Syracuse, it was freshman Ryan McMahon's turn in overtime. With a 10- or an 11-man rotation, depending on who's healthy, Louisville is among the deepest teams out there. Yet with contributions from so many guys, it's harder for anyone besides Mitchell to fully stand out. The ACC shuffle. So Louisville is a contender, huh? So is North Carolina. And Florida State. And Duke. And Virginia. And don't forget about Notre Dame, either. There's an element of the 2011 Big East at play in this year's Atlantic Coast Conference. They aren't doppelg\u00e4ngers, as some would want you to believe; the bottom five of the Big East that season provided virtually no resistance to the top 11, creating polarized conditions that helped maximize NCAA tournament participation. But like that version of the Big East, a quality team in this year's ACC is part of an avalanche. Some will simply draw more attention than others. It doesn't help the Cardinals that they're 1-4 against the top six in the conference (including a sweep at the hands of nemesis Virginia, which owns a 5-1 mark against Louisville since it joined the ACC). High-end road performance. If there is a portion of Louisville's postseason resume to take issue with, it is how it has fared away from home against high-caliber opposition. The Cardinals have done much of their best work at home, knocking off Duke, Kentucky, Miami and Purdue. Virginia Tech could join that list Saturday. Louisville owns a neutral-court defeat of Wichita State, and has knocked off Georgia Tech, Pittsburgh and Syracuse while rolling up a 5-3 record in true road games. Pitino's bunch isn't in danger for getting seriously dinged with seeding, and beating good teams on the road isn't a breeze. But it does provide a note of caution. Is the offense good enough? Maybe. It's better than it was the last two years, when the Cardinals were occasionally difficult to watch (granted, that often came against Virginia). Mitchell, who is constructing a season worthy of an all-conference nod, has played particularly well since Christmas. The return of Snider, who averages a turnover every 20.6 minutes, provides a needed source of stability. The Cardinals are best described as an opportunistic offense. They've cracked 85 points on five occasions in league play, doing so against Pittsburgh (twice), Boston College, Clemson and N.C. State. Not coincidentally, those are the ACC's four least efficient defenses in conference play. Louisville's good offense and elite defense will win it plenty more games between now and the end of the season. It's a good combination, perhaps even enough to have a shot to snip the nets in the desert. It would also come as no surprise if another good offense-elite defense opponent (Baylor, Florida, Oregon, Virginia or Wisconsin, perhaps?) brought an end to their season late next month.

            "body": "A man is arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents Feb. 7 during a targeted enforcement operation. (Charles Reed/U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via AP) This post is updated with DHS confirmation that the draft memo is legitimate - but that never made its way up the ladder. During the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump toyed with the idea of deploying a \"deportation force\" to round up and deport undocumented immigrants. Then he waffled on that proposal for a few months. On Friday morning, it looked for a moment like it was back again. The Associated Press reported that the Trump administration has considered dispatching 100,000 National Guard troops to, in AP's words, \"round up unauthorized immigrants.\" BREAKING: Trump administration considers mobilizing as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants. - The Associated Press (@AP) February 17, 2017 According to AP, which says it obtained a draft memo: The 11-page document calls for the unprecedented militarization of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana. Four states that border on Mexico are included in the proposal - California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas - but it also encompasses seven states contiguous to those four - Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. The memo is here. The White House quickly denied it, with press secretary Sean Spicer saying it's \"100 percent not true. It is false. It is irresponsible to be saying this.\" Spicer added that there is \"no effort\" to do this, but the AP report didn't say the effort actually exists - only that it has been considered. And Spicer said he couldn't be certain that it wasn't discussed somewhere within the administration. This is not true. DHS also confirms it is 100% false https://t.co/MFIJci7XaU - Sean Spicer (@PressSec) February 17, 2017 Not true. https://t.co/T8rA87kJaU - Michael C. Short (@MCShort45) February 17, 2017 We now know the draft did exist - in some form. The Department of Homeland Security denies it was written by Secretary John Kelly, as it appears in the memo and as AP reported. (It stands to reason that it was prepared as if Kelly had written it, when in fact he hadn't.) But DHS also tells The Post that the draft memo is real, despite being a \"very early, pre-decisional draft that never made it to the secretary.\" In other words, the White House seems to quibble with the idea that this is a proposal actively under consideration, but the memo is legit. Spicer's contention that this was \"100 percent not true\" doesn't really hold up. At the same time, the White House doth protest a little too much here. Spicer seemed genuinely peeved that this was being reported, but it's not actually that outlandish an idea next to Trump's rhetoric on this issue. In fact, it sure sounds like what Trump talked about early in his campaign and as recently as November. When he was on the campaign trail in 2016, President Trump said that he intends to create a deportation task force for removing violent undocumented immigrants in the U.S. (The Washington Post) As a candidate, Trump at one point said he would deport every illegal immigrant and favorably cited President Dwight D. Eisenhower's controversial \"Operation Wetback\" as a road map for how to do so - despite the operation being criticized as inhumane. Trump would later seem to back off that proposal and even appeared to entertain the idea of comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to legal status for some undocumented immigrants. As with many of Trump's proposals, though, this seemed to change by the day or week, with Trump not offering any firm commitment one way or another. And even as this was happening, his team wasn't totally disowning the idea of a deportation force. Asked about it twice, Kellyanne Conway said \"to be determined.\" Shortly after being elected, though, he moved back toward large-scale deportations, telling \"60 Minutes\" in an interview that he would focus deportation efforts on criminals but also that he would deport between 2 million and 3 million undocumented immigrants - a number that suggests it would go beyond just those criminals. After all, there were only about 11 million total illegal immigrants in the United States as of 2014, according to Pew. But Trump has wagered that there may actually be more and has accused a large percentage of them of being dangerous criminals, despite evidence to the contrary. So the operating assumption has been that Trump would move to deport millions of illegal immigrants. The question was how he would make it happen, given the scale of operations required to deport one out of every four undocumented immigrants in this country. And in that context, a deportation force of 100,000 National Guard troops seems to fit with what Trump was advocating. Perhaps the most notable thing to come out of all of this is that the White House seems to be - at least for the moment - disowning the idea of a deportation force in a way their boss simply hasn't. We'll see if that continues to be the company line.",

One of the primary factors affecting admission to Ivy League schools is...wait for it...whether one or both of your parents attended the school.  To wit:\n\n\"Most colleges encourage legacy admissions because it keeps check-writing graduates happy. U.S. News's college guide factors alumni giving into its rankings; the more grads who give, the higher a school's rating. \n\nMany colleges can't afford to alienate alumni donors. At the University of Virginia, roughly half of legacies are admitted, according to admissions dean Jack Blackburn: \"If it weren't for the private support we get, we wouldn't be doing the good things we're doing at UVa.\" \n\nThe Wall Street Journal recently put a statistical face on alumni clout in admissions. Children of graduates make up 10 to 15 percent of incoming classes at most Ivy League schools, according to the Journal. Harvard accepts 40 percent and Princeton accepts 35 percent of legacies but only 11 percent of all applicants. The University of Pennsylvania rakes 41 percent of legacy applicants yet only 21 percent overall. At Notre Dame, nearly a quarter of students are children of graduates.\"\n\nDoes that seem fair, or do you think legacy kids just always happen to be the best-qualified applicants?\n\nAs you might guess, that favored legacy pool does not include a lot of Hispanics, who tend to trend toward lower economic status than the average Ivy League applicant.  But to keep going, Ivy League grads tend to do well in society and business compared to others, so if you want Hispanics to be more competitive in the future, one way to promote that is to get them into the game.  There are lots of preferences in play for lots of reasons.  It's not all racial, and even the part that is may be that way for valid reasons.",

            "body": "President Trump has made a huge deal of his attempts to bring back blue-collar manufacturing jobs that have gone overseas and to shame companies into building plants here rather than in other countries. Both of which I think are fine. But Trump would probably get greater value for working-class Americans - and for American consumers - by spending some of his time leaning on companies to preserve a huge, threatened class of blue-collar jobs: cashiers. Yes, cashiers. Speaking up for cashiers, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics says is the second-largest occupation in the country, wouldn't be as glamorous or tweet-able as berating Ford or General Motors or Carrier for the loss of American jobs. [Why bodyslamming big companies is good for America] But it would be a great way for him to get back to playing offense and showing he cares about the working class. Supporting the nation's 3.5 million cashiers could help preserve the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of low-paid people who are in entry-level jobs or rehabilitating-themselves jobs or trying-to-feed-their-family jobs. What's more, there's even an example, not far from Trump Tower in New York, of how preserving cashier-type jobs could be done, at minimal (or perhaps no) cost to consumers. It's in my home state of New Jersey, which has saved thousands of such jobs - those of gas station attendants. It's the unintended but welcome outgrowth of the state's 1949 ban on the self-pumping of gasoline, which many out-of-staters ridicule. Even so, it is so popular that Jersey residents have resisted repeated attempts to end it. Now, let's step back a bit. The number of cashier jobs - No. 2 only to retail sales clerks, according to the BLS - was almost exactly the same in 2015 (the most recent year for which statistics are available) as in 2005, even though total U.S. employment was up by 7.6 million. Still, it's obvious that these jobs are threatened as never before. [How to save good jobs] Go into any large, reasonably modern supermarket, drug store or retail store, and you see more and more self-checkout lines and fewer and fewer manned cashier lines. McDonald's is using self-checkout in some locations. Even Costco - a big company that seems to care about employing people - is experimenting with it. And here's the crowning blow. Amazon, which has upended America's retail business (and whose chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post), is building physical stores that have no cashiers. If Amazon's initiative succeeds, can cashier-less days at mainstream operations be far behind? Look, I'm not proposing that the United States turn into a modern-day version of old-style Russia, where it took half a dozen people to check you out of a store. And I'm not proposing to return to pre-bar code days, when checkout lines were slower and there was more work for cashiers. But I just look at the gas stations in New Jersey and compare them with the large, modern retail outlets in Atlanta's northern suburbs, where my wife and I recently spent considerable time. Georgia customers using the self-checkout line got no savings whatever in return for doing the store's work. Late at night, at least some big stores had so few cashiers on duty that self-checkout became the norm. By contrast, at New Jersey gas stations, someone pumps my gas. That's a boon to those of us, like me, who have arthritic wrists that don't react well to pumping my own gas, which I did in Georgia. And the Jersey gas lines moved more quickly. [What to expect at work in 2017] Sal Risalvato, executive director of the New Jersey trade group that represents gas stations and convenience stores, estimates there are about 9,000 gas-pumping jobs in the state. (The BLS once tracked Jersey gas-pumping jobs but no longer does.) Risalvato, who wants the self-pumping ban repealed, estimates that having attendants increases the price of gas by about 10 cents a gallon. To put that in context: The state increased gas taxes by 23 cents a gallon in November, and the recent average cost of gas ranged from $2.32 a gallon for regular to $2.79 for premium, according to GasBuddy. Robert Scott III, a professor at New Jersey's Monmouth University who in 2007 published a scholarly article about the self-pumping ban, thinks it adds little or nothing to gas prices. A major reason, he says, is that insurance costs for Jersey gas stations are lower than they would be if customers pumped their own gas. To be sure, you don't see the plight of cashiers portrayed nightly on cable news, and there's no big public fuss made when cashier jobs quietly slip away. But if Trump can dig out of his current problems and get back to playing offense, he could do a lot of good for cashiers and himself by publicly leaning on retail chains to preserve those jobs or even add to them. And who can say? Just as we Jerseyites appreciate having gas pumped for us, store customers across the country would probably come to appreciate cashier-based checkout. We'd keep cashiers working instead of having to live in poverty or go on welfare or file for disability. We'd all win. And so would Trump.

A gas station might leave the self-serve option available, but have one or two attendants who could pump gas if requested and also increase safety by keeping an eye on things. The gas station owner could promote this as a valuable customer service, making THEIR station the preferred place to fuel up. Of course, if insurance costs went down, this would be implemented in all stations under a brand: \"Fill up at Stripes - service with a smile,\" and so on.\n\nFuel attendants are just one example of jobs that might be re-discovered with some research and a creative push-back against global automation.

            "body": "The president spoke to and took questions from reporters at the White House for more than an hour, Feb. 16. Here are key moments from that event. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) At yesterday's surreal press conference, President Trump expressed his amazement that he picks up the newspaper or turns on the TV and sees stories saying that his administration is in chaos. \"Yet it is the exact opposite,\" he said. \"This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine.\" Somehow, the assembled reporters and other onlookers restrained themselves from breaking out into gales of laughter. While it might eventually get its act together, at least at this early stage, this is the most disorganized and chaotic administration in memory. It's particularly disturbing that the president and those who work for him seem to be in a state somewhere between denial and delusion, wherein they insist that everything this White House does turns out splendidly. Let's review some examples of this \"fine-tuned machine\" in action: Trump spends the first few days of his presidency insisting against all evidence that his was the best-attended inauguration in history; no one on his staff seems to be able to stop him. In White House press secretary Sean Spicer's first briefing, he berates reporters, lies to them, then stalks off without taking questions, a performance so bizarre that it becomes the topic of two separate \"Saturday Night Live\" skits. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway later asserts that Spicer was not actually lying but deploying \"alternative facts.\" After Conway takes to cable news to endorse Ivanka Trump's clothing line, the Office of Government Ethics urges the White House to open an investigation of her obvious violation of ethics rules. A torrent of leaks floods from the White House, many portraying the president as ignorant, impulsive and erratic. The first military action authorized by Trump, a raid on an al-Qaeda compound in Yemen, goes disastrously wrong, resulting in the death of a Navy SEAL, multiple civilians killed and the loss of a $70 million aircraft. In phone calls with foreign leaders, Trump regales them with tales of his spectacular election victory before turning hostile. Details of the calls are promptly leaked to the media. Trump signs an executive order placing his political adviser Steve Bannon on the \"principals committee\" of the National Security Council, an unprecedented move. Trump is apparently unaware that he had done so, later becoming angry at aides who had failed to explain it to him. Trump signs an executive order banning all refugees and nationals of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. The White House fails to consult the relevant agencies and legal advisers in writing the order. The result is chaos in airports across the country and hurried changes in the implementation of the order, and before long it is struck down by the courts. When the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, decides that the order cannot be defended in court, Trump fires her. Trump's choice to be secretary of the Army, Vincent Viola, abruptly withdraws from consideration. Rex Tillerson's choice to be his No. 2 at the State Department, Iran-contra figure and convicted criminal Elliott Abrams, is vetoed by Trump after he learns that Abrams said unkind things about him during the campaign. While dining at his Mar-a-Lago club with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump is told that North Korea has just conducted a provocative missile launch. It doesn't seem to occur to anyone to move to a secure and private location to discuss it, so Abe, Trump and his aides examine documents and strategize over their response in full view of club members snapping photos of the scene to put up on their social media pages. Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is forced to resign after it is revealed that he misled members of the administration about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. A new report says that Flynn also misled the FBI when he was questioned about them. Trump's choice to replace Flynn, retired vice admiral Robert Harward, turns down the job. According to CNN, \"A friend of Harward's said he was reluctant to take the job because the White House seems so chaotic. Harward called the offer a 's--- sandwich,' the friend said.\" The president's choice for labor secretary withdraws at the last moment amid allegations of domestic abuse and the employment of an undocumented immigrant. Six White House aides are fired and escorted from the building after they fail FBI background checks. It takes nearly a month into Trump's tenure before the White House finally finds a communications director willing to take the job. Of the 696 government positions that require Senate confirmation, Trump has nominated 34 people, 13 of whom have been confirmed, leaving 662 positions where no one has even been nominated. But while this spectacular goat rodeo is going on behind the scenes, in public the president and his aides insist that all is well. Spicer says that the Yemen raid was \"absolutely a success.\" Trump says that \"we had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban\" and that Michael Flynn is a fantastic person who was maligned by the media. Perhaps you can attribute this all to the fact that the president himself and so many of his key aides have no government experience. Or perhaps there's some other cause. But either way, it's almost impossible to imagine this White House or this president actually admitting that something they did went less than perfectly. Among other things, this may prevent them from changing course or learning from their errors. If you're busy insisting that your screw-ups were actually triumphs, you'll never consider what you might do differently. Which suggests that this fine-tuned machine is going to run no better over the next four years than it's running now.",

            "body": "President Trump berated the media repeatedly at his press conference on Feb. 16, calling CNN, the New York Times and other outlets \"dishonest\" and \"very fake news,\" for reporting unfavorable stories about him. (Video: Reuters / Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) If you read the New York Times report that several of President Trump's aides and associates communicated regularly during the campaign with Russian intelligence officials, you know that Trump's rebuttal at a news conference Thursday made little sense. That's a big \"if,\" however. The reality is that Trump supporters, generally speaking, don't read the Times. When the Pew Research Center surveyed voters after the election, the Times didn't even register among Trump backers' primary news sources. The Trump base's media consumption habits - of which the president is undoubtedly aware - is the key to success for attacks on \"fake news\" reports by the Times and other major outlets that Trump voters disdain. If his supporters don't actually read a report, such as the one the Times ran Wednesday, then Trump doesn't have to respond to it, really. He can respond to a version of his own invention, and his backers will be none the wiser. [Donald Trump's combative, grievance-filled news conference, annotated] To see how Trump's strategy works, let's review what he said about the New York Times story and a subsequent report in the Wall Street Journal at Thursday's news conference: The failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was - it's a joke. And the people mentioned in the story, I noticed they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. ... I think the one person - I don't think I've ever spoken to him. I don't think I've ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time. I don't think I ever met him. ... The other person said he never spoke to Russia; never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries. That's what he does. I mean, people know that. That's Mr. [Paul] Manafort. ... He said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories. So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. ... And just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Times's story yesterday. ... I will say that I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in the Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in the New York Times, put it on the front page? For starters, it is flat-out false that these newspapers did not call for comment. The Journal, which reported that some U.S. intelligence officials are withholding bits of information from Trump, quoted a White House official, who said \"there is nothing that leads us to believe that this is an accurate account of what is actually happening.\" The White House declined to provide a comment to the Times. If you read the stories, you knew as soon as Trump opened his mouth that his complaint about \"never get[ting] phone calls from the media\" was illegitimate. But if you didn't read the stories, you might have believed that the White House didn't have a chance to comment. [Donald Trump is doing A-okay with the only people he cares about] Trump also was wrong when he asserted that Manafort's denial of contact with Russia was omitted. The Times interviewed Manafort and printed his response. And Trump's reference to \"the three people that they talked about\" was a bit misleading. He could have said \"three of the people they talked about,\" but he implied (inaccurately) that the Times's report dealt with only three people when he said \"the three people.\" The Times reported that U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted calls involving other, unnamed Trump associates. The three people named in the story were Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman; Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser; and Roger Stone, a veteran and controversial Republican operative (and longtime Trump friend) who worked for the campaign early in the GOP primary. Trump said he \"noticed they were on television ... saying they never even spoke to Russia,\" but the denials Trump \"noticed\" were not new. The Times noted in its story that \"all of the men have strongly denied that they had any improper contacts with Russian officials.\" Trump delivered a classic straw-man argument in his Thursday news conference. He knocked down a version of the Times report that didn't really exist - a version in which his White House and his former campaign staffers were viciously attacked without any opportunity to defend themselves. The ploy was obvious to anyone who actually read the report, but the president made the safe bet that his backers did not. 1 of 69 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 See what President Trump has been doing since taking office View Photos The new president's tumultuous first weeks have been marked by controversial executive orders and conflicts with the media.

The president's views are primarily anti-democratic. His wanton disregard and lack of concern for the majority of the country is duly noted with every stupid remark he makes. Yet he is talking to a base of support that agrees with what he says even as he makes it up. Agrees with relish if it denigrates, dismisses and denies the foundations of the United States of America. Fact check away, it makes no difference. Denounce the fool, it makes no difference. Nero fiddles as Rome burns and the minority is apoplectic with glee.

I wrote the criteria that define this disorder, and Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t meet them. He may be a world-class narcissist, but this doesn\u2019t make him mentally ill, because he does not suffer from the distress and impairment required to diagnose mental disorder.\n\nMr. Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity, self-absorption and lack of empathy.

More than three months later, he's obsessed with the numbers for that election and he can't let it go. He's visibly angry and distressed that the victory wasn't overwhelming and historic.

            "body": "West Potomac's Daryl Mackey Jr. (10) is averaging 23 points over his last four games. (Katherine Frey / The Washington Post) Championship Friday is upon us in Northern Virginia. Winners in tonight's boys' and girls' conference tournaments lock up important seeding for next week's regional tournament. In other words, win tonight and make the road to Richmond for the state championship a whole lot easier. Here are previews of tonight's matchups: Conference 5 When: girls at 6 p.m., boys at 8 p.m. Where: Chantilly High School Boys: Chantilly (15-8) vs. Centreville (16-7) These local rivals split their season series. The home team had the edge each time. Senior guard Brett Caslavka does a little bit of everything for Chantilly. He orchestrates the Chargers' offense, which also features seniors Daniel Carmichael, a forward who leads the team in scoring, and Kendall McHugh, a guard averaging 10.6 points per game. Centreville will lean on the trio of Marcus Mack, Tyler Lohman and Bryce Douglas, which combined for 36 points in the Wildcats' victory over Chantilly. Girls: No. 15 Oakton (22-2) vs. Herndon (17-6) These teams have also split their season series, but Oakton was shorthanded with a string of suspensions when it fell back in January. The Cougars' scoring comes from seniors Maddie Royle, Delaney Connolly and Kailyn Fee, who together average almost 50 points per game. Indeya Sanders, an American commit, leads Herndon from her point guard position. She feeds Devyne Newman, a senior sharpshooter, on the perimeter and Taylor Strawser, a senior forward, in the post. Conference 6 When: girls at 6 p.m., boys at 8 p.m. Where: South Lakes High School Boys: Hayfield (20-4) vs. Madison (18-6) This game might well be decided by Hayfield's supporting cast, or how Madison defends it. The Hawks' Langston Gaither enters the night averaging 24.6 points per game. In Hayfield's loss to Madison, he had 20 points and only one teammate scored in double figures. In the Hawks' win, he had 15 and three other players each had 11. Senior guard Johnny Corish has taken over the tournament for Madison. In Madison's first-round game against Yorktown, he poured in 31 points. Girls: Langley (20-4) vs. Madison (13-10) Madison backed into the tournament with three straight losses, but ripped off back-to-back wins over Fairfax and McLean to reach the finals. Junior guard Katy Sharon had 18 points, including four three-pointers, to lead the Warhawks in an upset win over McLean. Langley has kept four of its last five opponents below 30 points with a choking half-court defense. The Saxons have won both meetings with Madison by a combined 26 points. Conference 7 When: girls at 6 p.m., boys at 8 p.m. Where: South County High School Boys: No. 17 West Potomac (21-3) vs. No. 19 W.T. Woodson (20-4) Three possessions have separated West Potomac and W.T. Woodson this season. The two have split their meetings in the regular season and the margin of victory is a combined seven points. Sophomore guard Daryl Mackey Jr., has emerged as one of Virginia's preeminent scorers. He's averaging 23.0 points per game in his last four. Senior guard Khalil Williams Diggins is averaging 15.7 points per game on the year. Matthew Urbach and Jason Aigner have been thorns in the Wolverines' side for Woodson. In the Cavaliers' games against West Potomac, the pair has scored 81 points. Girls: No. 10 T.C. Williams (23-1) vs. West Potomac (16-7) T.C. Williams hasn't lost to a local opponent yet this season, and has gone two months without a defeat. The Titans have swept the Wolverines this year with wins of 68-31 and 56-19. In two of T.C. Williams' last three games, opponents couldn't break into double-digit scoring. West Potomac, behind Ty Taylor's 11.0 scoring average, will have to be on its game to break the Titans' months-long momentum. Conference 13 (Virginia 5A) When: girls at 6 p.m., boys at 8 p.m. Where: Wakefield High School Boys: Wakefield (19-4) vs. Marshall (17-6) Wakefield is undefeated in conference play and won both its games against Marshall this season. Senior guard Halil Parks led the Warriors with 18 points when the teams met two weeks ago. Marshall's senior center Jack Foley had 21 points to lead all scorers when the Statesmen came within 11 points of Wakefield back in January. Girls: Edison (15-7) vs. Wakefield (21-3) Neither the Eagles nor the Warriors have been able to defend home court, as they've jousted for a conference regular-season title. Wakefield senior Lyrin Hatcher has become a dominant paint presence in the conference. She had 19 points in a loss to Edison on Jan. 31. The Eagles countered with three scorers in double figures, including 17 points from sophomore Carole Miller, maybe the conference's best guard.",

            "body": "It can be a challenge to pitch policy to a president with little interest in policy. (OLIVIER DOULIERY/ABACA PRESS) As the White House goes, so goes K Street. With each new administration, lobbyists, interest groups and other swamp creatures scramble to tailor strategies for getting their issues on the president's agenda, developing fresh arguments grounded in the White House occupants' principles, priorities and policy goals. Obviously, no one expected to sway the coolly cerebral, professorial and progressive President Barack Obama with the same arguments that won over a self-proclaimed \"decider\" and \"gut-player\" like President George W. Bush. But now, influence-peddlers face an even greater challenge: figuring out how to best position themselves before President Trump, an unlikely commander in chief whose policy agenda and worldview appear thus far to lack the coherence of those of his 44 most recent predecessors. Consider these examples of how ploys for presidential attention may have evolved over the past three administrations. Your best case for investing in education Bush: One way to reduce regulations is to enact multi-purpose ones. For example, when it comes to important questions like \"Is our children learning?\" \"Anyone see the twins?\" and \"Will Jeb ever be president?,\" here's a threefer: No Child Left Behind. Obama: Unfortunately, statistics show that 93 percent of Americans still lack the reading comprehension skills to follow a conversation between you and Michiko Kakutani. Trump: No, sir, the state standards have nothing to do with the pizza place. Wait, this whole time you thought it was Comet Core? Your best case for standing strong against Russia Bush: We need to mobilize our most sophisticated intelligence resources to assess Vladimir Putin's intentions - so would you mind looking deeply into his eyes again? Obama: As much as we hoped for a new chapter in this relationship, Putin's actions in Crimea suggest he forgot there's no \"I\" in \"peregruzka,\" which the experts at State are at least 80 percent positive is Russian for \"reset.\" Trump: The best way to remove this cloud of suspicion over your Russia dealings is to remember that smart sanctions are like a great necktie: broad, bold and designed to hit below the belt. Your best case against torture Bush: It paints an ugly picture of our country abroad. And you wouldn't want to paint an ugly picture, would you? Obama: Since you've already made clear that the United States doesn't torture folks, let's just break for lunch. Here, I brought you seven almonds. Trump: Mad Dog and I don't want to Merkel-splain about international conventions to you, sir, but who needs waterboarding when we could just make them watch \"Saturday Night Live\"? Your best case for fighting climate change Bush: Even if you don't believe the science, we can't misunderestimate the possible consequences: The hotter the weather, the bigger the storms, the more you'll have to deal with Kanye. Obama: Sen. James Inhofe found a snowball, so you can go ahead and cancel the Paris conference. Haha, obviously just kidding. Trump: As the evidence - namely that DVD Leonardo DiCaprio gave to your daughter - makes clear, there's at least some possibility that energy from the sun could be messing with our greenhouse gases. As you said, sir, you can do anything when you're a star. Your best case for paid family leave Bush: This common-sense policy will open new doors of opportunity for hardworking American families. And we all know how hard it can be to open doors. Obama: The United States is the only industrialized nation that doesn't give workers paid family leave - and I imagine that makes America a little too exceptional for your taste. Trump: If we let new mothers stay home until they're done with the disgusting stuff like breast pumps and baby weight, we can Make Working Moms 8s Again. Your best case for same-sex marriage Bush: Even the vice president is for it, and you're supposed to be the one with the good heart. Obama: The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. And it needs to bend a little faster than we planned because Joe went off script today. Trump: Daddy, you're embarrassing me and Jared in front of our friends!

            "body": "The State Department under Rex Tillerson, who has been among President Trump's least visible Cabinet officials and is still lacking much of his senior staff, is undergoing further shrinkage in its upper echelons, according to current and former U.S. officials. Kristie Kenney, a three-time ambassador and career Foreign Service officer who has served as State Department counselor for the past year, has been told that her services are no longer needed in that job and that her staff is to be reassigned. The offices of counselor, who provides strategic guidance to the secretary, and the empty slot of deputy secretary for management may not be filled, officials said. Thomas Shannon, Kenney's predecessor as counselor and now the undersecretary for political affairs, is expected to become acting deputy secretary for policy until someone is permanently approved. Tillerson's choice for the job, Elliot Abrams, was vetoed last week by the White House. Abrams, who served in the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, subsequently speculated that he was blocked because of statements he made during the presidential race that were seen as critical of Trump's candidacy. [In diplomatic debut, Tillerson takes firm line on Russian role in Ukraine] The appointment of Tillerson, a former ExxonMobil executive with no previous government experience, was viewed favorably by much of the Republican establishment, which sees him as a steadying influence. But since his arrival at the department on Feb. 2, he has made only one public comment, a brief statement Thursday at the G-20 conference of major world economic powers being held in Germany. He took no questions. Five of the eight senior staff members who accompanied Tillerson on the trip - his first as America's top diplomat - are serving in temporary capacities. Tillerson has not appointed a press secretary, and the State Department - which traditionally holds daily media briefings - has not held a single one. Department officials said that Tillerson has described himself as being in a \"listening mode\" until he feels up to speed on the issues. His silence comes as the administration has become embroiled in controversy over contacts officials in the Trump campaign and transition had with Russian officials. Although the secretary of state is traditionally included in virtually all formal presidential contacts with foreign leaders, Tillerson did not attend Trump's meetings over the past week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Asked about the changes in the State Department's seventh-floor executive suites, R.C. Hammond, who was press secretary for Newt Gingrich's 2012 presidential campaign and currently is a department spokesperson, said in a statement that \"the State Department is made up of a corps of very talented public servants. In some cases, we are redeploying people to new assignments where they can immediately put their talents to work.\" The removals and reassignments, some of which were first reported by CBS News, come as many senior jobs at State remain empty or filled by acting officials following the departure of those in charge of regional affairs and top issues such as nonproliferation and human rights. Most were career officials who were asked to leave, but there was also a handful who resigned.

            "body": "\"Why do you want to come to the The Post?\" That was what an interviewer asked me when I first applied to the newspaper three decades ago. My answer was simple: \"I want to be part of my times.\" That kept popping into my mind after interviewing Arthur Levitt Jr., the 86-year-old former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. I have interviewed many interesting people over the years, but few match Levitt's claim on being relevant to his times. He is best known for his record longevity at the SEC, but - to borrow a phrase from one of his professions - that short sells the entire arc of a career that is a lesson in reinvention. Cattle salesman, journalist, publisher and card-carrying member of the financial establishment. His \"Take on the Street\" business book sold 100,000 copies. Levitt, 86, never really settled into a quiet retirement. Among other things, he serves as a consultant to seven high-tech companies. (Amanda Voisard/For The Washington Post) \"It's my personality,\" the Air Force veteran said. \"My mother used to say, 'Go out for everything.' \" So he did. Track team. Honor society. School newspaper. And later, stockbroker, businessman, political troubleshooter (he served on two base-closing commissions), chairman of the American Stock Exchange, chairman of the New York City Economic Development Commission, high-tech consultant. A conversation about his life is a turn through U.S. political and financial history, including the Carlyle Group, financier Sanford Weill, actress Ethel Merman, billionaire and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, investment bank Goldman Sachs, Wall Street legend Maurice R. \"Hank\" Greenberg, and politicians including former senator Phil Gramm (R-Tex., with whom he shares a love for Labrador retrievers), and former congressmen Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.), John Dingell (D-Mich.) and Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y). He has worked for Time-Life. He owned Roll Call, now a daily take on Capitol Hill. He occasionally pens missives on finance for the Wall Street Journal. Levitt's latest reinvention is serving as a consultant to seven high-tech companies. Those ventures bring him in contact with Silicon Valley stars like Max Levchin, co-founder of PayPal, and Mike Cagney of Social Finance Inc. \"I am in touch with some of the smartest minds in America, and in a field with which I had very little experience,\" he said. In addition to the tech companies, he sits on the board of privately held Bloomberg L.P. Levitt's experience in finance, markets and securities, not to mention his Rolodex and political clout, makes him a valuablecommodity. \"I can help those companies in terms of management,\" he said, \"choosing the right people, choosing and positioning the board of directors, helping them finance the companies by introducing them to potential investors.\" He learns from them, too. \"I have been absolutely fascinated by their ability to make a new way, develop new strategies and utilize our capital markets more constructively than they have ever before been used,\" he said. His interest in politics and finance comes naturally. In his family, Levitt grew up in a family where \"the conversations around the kitchen table every night involved pensions and the sanctity of the pension system.\" If his mother blessed him with assertiveness, his father's contribution was independence. Arthur Levitt Sr. was a politician and good at it. He was elected New York state comptroller for six terms, spanning 24 years. \"He was his own man,\" Levitt says. But the son made an early decision not to follow his father into politics. \"It was too uncertain. Too cutthroat,\" he said. \"I didn't want to go through the enormous stress of running for office, having seen my dad do it.\" He majored in English at Williams College, graduating in 1952. He was accepted at Yale Law School, but his father advised him to pass. He instead would follow the path of an uncle, Robert Levitt (one of actress Ethel Merman's four spouses) who was publisher of the American Weekly, a Sunday newspaper insert popular in the early 20th century. After two years in the Air Force, he worked at Time Inc., first in Cincinnati and then New York. He was making around $12,000 a year for Time when a friend named William vanden Heuvel, a contemporary who is an attorney, businessman and former diplomat, recommended that Levitt take a job with a relative in the cattle business. Never one to say no, Levitt moved to Kansas City and took the $25,000-a-year job. The cattle business was attractive to high-income individuals seeking tax-advantaged income. Plus, Levitt was good at it. After a year on the Plains, he returned to Manhattan and opened an office on 57th Street and Madison Avenue, where he continued to sell cattle. One of his cattle customers told him if he could sell cows, he could sell stock, and recommended that he join a stock brokerage operated by the man's son-in-law. The firm eventually became Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt. Some competitors referred to the firm as \"Corned Beef With Lettuce.\" The firm changed its name nearly a dozen times because of acquisitions and expansions. It was eventually acquired by American Express. Levitt had landed his first fortune. The financial independence allowed him to pursue a series of other jobs. From 1978 to 1989, he chaired the American Stock Exchange. He bought Roll Call during that time, and turned it into a successful publication covering Capitol Hill. (One congressman helped immensely by slipping Levitt the home addresses of every U.S. representative, allowing Roll Call to land on their front doorstep instead of their offices.) He developed a warm rapport with many politicians, including Rangel, who became the powerful Ways and Means chairman, former congressman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) and Edward J. Markey, now the Democratic senator from Massachusetts. \"I like these guys,\" he said of politicians. He liked schmoozing. Playing baseball with them.He liked the rituals. Levitt sold Roll Call to the Economist in 1993 for $15 million, fattening his fortune. President Bill Clinton appointed him to the SEC in 1993. The lifelong Democrat said he has no idea why Clinton picked him. It was another reinvention and an ideal match. \"My experience on two base-closing commissions and testifying before Congress many times and owning the congressional newspaper - you couldn't get better training,\" he says. \"I was very comfortable with the political demands.\" Skeptics at the time questioned whether someone who had made a fortune on Wall Street and had run the American Stock Exchange could be the industry's watchdog. One big miss was the years-long Bernard Madoff scam, which went on under the noses of the Internal Revenue Service and several regulators. But Levitt's SEC tenure was known for its activism. \"My overwhelming focus was on the importance of the individual investor over corporations, over market structure, over everything else,\" said Levitt, adding that he knew what to look for. \"I saw and probably engaged in some of the practices I had come to oppose, such as sales commissions based on volume, higher commissions. \"I transferred millions of dollars from the pockets of brokers to the pockets of investors,\" he said. You would think he would have gently headed into retirement after his SEC term ended in 2001. He could spend time with his family, his beloved Labradors and the friends who join him on his famouslygrueling wilderness trips. It doesn't seem like he's slowed down even a step. He wrote a report on the finances of the National Hockey League in 2004. His passion for dogs keeps his 20-year involvement with Guiding Eyes for the Blind, a nonprofit organization that trains guide dogs. He worked as an adviser to the Carlyle Group for several years, and then there is the consulting with the tech companies, which he credits for reinventing him once more. But mom deserves most of the credit. As he put it: \"I followed my mother's direction to take on everything that comes my way and turn down nothing.\"",

Latin is originally from Guatemala but has been in the United States for 12 years. On the right is his son, Mauricio Amaya, 11. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post) A national \"Day Without Immigrants\" protest Thursday forced some D.C. restaurants, day-care centers and even schools to shut down or adjust their hours as the region's immigrants went on strike to highlight the role they play in the country. District, Measured - the blog from the D.C. Office of Revenue Analysis - released data coinciding with the strike, which provides a glimpse of this role. The numbers show the jobs immigrants hold and thus which local sectors may have been affected by the strike. Take a look at the interactive chart below. The highest percentage of immigrants are employed as carpenters and housekeepers, at about 80 percent. A large number of the city's immigrants are also child-care providers. Seventy-one percent of chefs or head cooks, 61 percent of cooks and 47 percent of food preparation workers in the District are immigrants. [Restaurants, schools close in 'Day Without Immigrants' protest] In the entire Washington region, about 48 percent of people working in the restaurant industry are foreign-born, according to data compiled by the Institute for Immigration Research at George Mason University. The chart also shows that these professions are the ones with the lowest pay. \"Most of the occupations with the highest concentrations of immigrants in D.C. are those with low or middle wages,\" District, Measured wrote. \"However, immigrants comprise almost half of D.C. workers in several high-wage occupations: economists (46 percent), mathematicians and statisticians (43 percent), and physical scientists (42 percent).\" The data come from the 2015 American Community Survey. A profession is considered low-wage if its median wage was in the bottom 25 percent of median wages across all jobs in D.C., or below $44,000. The median wages of high-wage jobs are in the top 25 percent, or annual salaries of more than $86,000.",

The congress deemed that it was necessary to limit immigration some time after WWll. That restriction is the law of the land so if you are not happy with the law of the land then work to change it. Most US citizens (but not all) are not against immigrants but want them to come to the legally. The immigrants know that it is illegal to come without the proper papers and they know that to cross the border they will be deported. \nThis can be changed. Just convince congress to change the law and the POTUS to sign the law.  It would have been easy for Obama and the democrat controlled congress to have done so during the first two years of Obama's administration but instead they chose to ignore the law on immigration. That teaches the population that the law of the land has no meaning. By changing the law immigration could be from unrestricted immigration to a full shut down of the border or some where in between. How ever if the immigrants feel that they have a right to come to the US any time any way that they want if the new law did not provide for unfettered immigration soon the immigrants would disrespect what ever restrictions that the new immigration law provided and would still come to the US as illegal  immigrants.

            "body": "I configured Twitter a couple of weeks ago to get text alerts on my phone whenever President Trump tweets. Bad! Now any moment of tranquility can be pierced by his random outbursts. I awake from a restful night to see: \"Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile. Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them!\" I'm pruning in the back yard on a Sunday afternoon and feel a vibration in my pocket: \"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\" (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) I'm commuting to work when I suddenly see: \"The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so they made up a story - RUSSIA. Fake news!\" The eruptions follow a similar pattern of dubious statement followed by exclamation: \"Our hero Ryan died on a winning mission (according to General Mattis), not a 'failure.' Time for the U.S. to get smart and start winning again!\" \"Had a great meeting at CIA Headquarters yesterday, packed house, paid great respect to Wall, long standing ovations, amazing people. WIN!\" \"The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\" [Trump says he runs a 'fine-tuned machine.' Here are all the ways that's not true.] But it turns out that this may not be just the way the president tweets. It may be the way he thinks. Ricocheting at his news conference Thursday afternoon from topic to unrelated topic and back again, Trump sounded like a walking ad for Ritalin. But pay close attention, and you realize his brain is actually scrolling through its own internal Twitter feed. Most thoughts are dispensed with in 140 characters or fewer. If he has a very big thought, he may give it 280 characters, or an extra tweet's worth. Then he'll jump to the next topic. His thought bursts are (often) internally consistent, even if they're contradicted by the facts or by things he himself said only moments earlier. I followed Trump's tweet-think during Thursday's rambling news conference: \"I see stories of chaos - chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine!\" (119 characters) \"People came out and voted like they've never seen before,\" he said of his 306 electoral votes. \"I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan!\" (126 and, in case you were wondering, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush all exceeded 306 electoral votes - five times in all.) \"You can talk all you want about Russia, which was all . . . fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats!\" (137) \"The leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake - because so much of the news is fake!\" (86) How, I wondered, would history have turned out if those who came before us had their brains similarly wired to function in 140 characters or fewer? Intelligence \"sources\" provided me with intercepts of these thoughts, with actual Trump Twitter exclamations: Pharaoh, 1446 B.C.: \"Israelites had to come up with story as to why they were enslaved so long and so badly (400 years) so they made up a story - GOD. Fake news!\" Priam, king of Troy, 1200 B.C.: \"Cassandra says the horse shouldn't come in the city gates. She's been losing so long she doesn't know how to win. Not me!\" Julius Caesar, 44 B.C.: \"Do you believe it? Wife had bad dream, says I can't go to Senate because I will be murdered. Ridiculous and will be overturned!\" Napoleon, 1812: \"My so-called advisers warning of famine, dysentery, typhus if I invade Russia. Lies! Only emboldens the enemy!\" Donner Party, 1846: \"FAKE NEWS reports, fabricated deal, saying unsafe to take shortcut through the Sierra Nevadas in winter. Very dishonest!\" White House press secretary, 1865: \"The president saw a great show at Ford's Theatre last night, packed house, long standing ovations, amazing people. WIN!\" George Custer, 1876: \"Leaks say we will be overwhelmed at Little Bighorn. Real scandal is classified info is illegally given out like candy. Very un-American!\" Edward Smith, 1912: \" 'Intelligence' from made-up 'sources' says there are icebergs. But fake news media refuses to mention my ship is unsinkable. Politics!\" Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933: \"I inherited a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess. A horrible mess! Bad!\" Winston Churchill, 1940: \"Germany is formally PUT ON NOTICE for invading France. Big trouble! If something happens, blame the courts. A lot of bad dudes out there!\" John F. Kennedy, 1961: \"Bay of Pigs was a winning mission (according to SecDef McNamara), not a 'failure.' Time for the U.S. to get smart and start winning again!\" George W. Bush, 2005: \"The levees held.

            "body": "Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, left, shakes hands with New Zealand's Prime Minister Bill English ahead of a bilateral meeting at the Hilton Hotel in Queenstown, New Zealand's South Island, on Friday. (Lukas Coch/European Pressphoto Agency) The day after President Trump delivered a lengthy \"fake news\" tirade against critical reporters and the media in general, the Australian prime minister suggested that such rhetoric was wrongheaded. And to prove his point, Malcolm Turnbull used a quote he said was from widely respected British wartime leader Winston Churchill. \"A very great politician, Winston Churchill, once said that politicians complaining about the newspapers is like a sailor complaining about the sea,\" Turnbull told reporters in New Zealand on Friday when asked about Trump's relationship with the media, Bloomberg News reports. \"There's not much point. It's the media we live with, and we have to get our message across, and we thank you all in the media for your kind attention.\" However, Turnbull may have unintentionally undermined his own argument. WorldViews could find no evidence that Churchill ever uttered that phrase or anything like it. Instead, the quote is widely attributed to another British firebrand of the same era - Enoch Powell, a politician whose name is near-synonymous in Britain with alleged racism due to a speech he gave in 1968 that warned of \"rivers of blood\" if immigration continued to Britain. David Freeman, director of publications at the International Churchill Society, wrote in an email that although Churchill had spoken approvingly of the press at points, Freeman was unaware of a statement like the one Turnbull referred to and could not find one in digitized archives of Churchill's writing and speeches. \"I am inclined to attribute this to what we call \"Churchillian Drift\" (more generically known as \"aphoristic drift\"),\" Freeman wrote, \"which is when some pithy remark is attributed to Churchill or some other giant from history such as Lincoln, Einstein, Martin Luther King, etc., in order to give the statement more gravitas.\" Regardless, the comments appear be the latest round in a back and forth between Trump and Turnbull - an unusual diplomatic disagreement between two traditional allies whose relationship has been shaken since Trump arrived in the White House. As The Washington Post reported, despite their countries' long friendship, the U.S. president and the Australian prime minister had a tense phone call the week after Trump entered office. According to U.S. officials briefed on the exchange, Trump had used the call to brag about his election win before turning his ire on a refugee deal between the United States and Australia agreed to under the previous administration. When Turnbull tried to get reassurances that the deal would still go through, Trump complained that Australia was trying to \"export the next Boston bombers\" with the \"dumb deal.\" Trump told Turnbull that the call was \"the worst by far\" of several he had had with world leaders that day - and abruptly ended the call less than halfway through a planned hour-long conversation. These reports of the call, at odds with officials readouts from both sides, soon sparked widespread controversy and focused attention on Trump's unorthodox discussions with a number of other world leaders. Trump, seeming to acknowledge the content of the call, later tweeted out further complaints about the refugee deal, while Turnbull offered an oblique acknowledgment that the discussion had been \"frank and forthright.\" Trump later sent two top advisers to reassure Australia's ambassador that their relationship was still strong. However, the U.S. president seemed to offer another dig at Turnbull on Thursday, telling reporters that the call \"wasn't that important.\" Turnbull's relationship with Trump has become a major factor in perceptions of his leadership of Australia. The Australian prime minister, leader of the center right Liberal party, has been in office since September 2015. His government has suffered from low approval ratings, but some suspect that his disagreement with Trump may boost his popularity among Australians, who generally have negative opinions of the U.S. president. The prime minister's attempted use of a Churchill quote may be notable. One of the first things Trump did when he entered the White House was return a bust of the British leader to the Oval Office - seemingly a nod to a controversy over reports that President Obama had removed the bust. (In fact, as The Post's Fact Checker Glenn Kessler has noted, the White House may soon have two busts of Churchill.) Turnbull's comments also came a day after the Australian newspaper reported that, despite their disagreement, Trump had expressed some admiration for the Australian leader's passion. \"There is a brawler there,\" the American president is reported to have said after their conversation ended, a U.S. source told the Australian's Simon Benson.

The scientist on the left is attaching his air hose, which supplies filtered air and maintains positive air pressure inside his orange suit. (James Gathany) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has temporarily suspended work at its most secure biosafety lab that handles dangerous pathogens because air hoses that are part of the required full-body protective suits worn by lab workers were not certified for breathable air, officials said Friday. About 100 employees have worked in the labs, at CDC's Atlanta headquarters, since the air hoses were introduced in 2008. There is no evidence that any of the employees were exposed to infectious agents or to hazardous material from breathing air through the hoses, said Stephan Monroe, CDC's associate director for laboratory science and safety. \"There have been no reports of acute health effects during the entire time\" the hoses have been in use in the labs, Monroe said. The problem was discovered during a routine inventory check Monday, and work at the labs was immediately suspended out of an abundance of caution, he said. The three affected labs are part of CDC's highest-security biosafety lab complex, known as BSL-4, where researchers work on some of the world's most dangerous pathogens, including Ebola and Marburg viruses. Workers in the labs must wear specially designed protective suits and may disconnect and reconnect to several air hoses while they are working inside the lab and when they go through a decontamination process to exit. The hoses are attached to an air supply in the ceiling. Monroe said the agency's swift response reflects how the culture of safety has changed at the agency, which experienced a series of incidents in 2014 involving the mishandling of dangerous pathogens, including Ebola, anthrax and botulism bacteria, at its labs. CDC is testing the air from the hoses to determine whether it meets federal standards for breathable air. Officials held an informational meeting with employees working in the labs earlier this week, he said. About 180 hoses need to be replaced. Some of the equipment is expected to arrive next week and will be installed before work in the labs resumes.

The hoses, which have been in use since 2008, may be perfectly OK for sending air to humans.  It was just that they had never been certified for such use.  This is not about a biohazard; it is about a hypothetical chemical hazard from gases leaking from the lining of the hose.  I suspect that, after 8 years, it is unlikely that any such hazard exists now or even if it ever did.\n\nNear the end, the article does state, \"CDC is testing the air from the hoses to determine whether it meets federal standards for breathable air.\"  But then it goes on to imply that they will be replaced whether they pass or not, which seems a bit odd."

(Ginnette Riquelme/Reuters) Pope Francis isn't taking the Trump party line. Just days before the election, he cautioned against \"social walls\" and \"false prophets\" fueling fear and intolerance in politics. \"No tyranny finds support without tapping into our fears,\" Francis said. \"This is key. Hence, all tyranny is terrorist.\" On the day of the inauguration, Francis warned against the rise of populist leaders like Adolf Hitler. \"Crises provoke fear, alarm. In my opinion, the most obvious example of European populism is Germany in 1933,\" the pope said. \"A people that was immersed in a crisis, that looked for its identity until this charismatic leader came and promised to give their identity back, and he gave them a distorted identity, and we all know what happened.\" In the past couple of weeks, he has stood with indigenous people, arguing that they have a \"right to prior and informed consent\" about what happens to their land and that their position \"should always prevail.\" It seemed to read like a rallying cry for supporters of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's fight against the Dakota Access pipeline. He has suggested that leaders should create \"bridges,\" not walls, and shouldn't ask others to pay for them. In a fairly pointed prayer intention, he criticized people who \"throw up skyscrapers\" and \"strike big real estate deals\" but ignore those on society's margins. And in a new letter, Francis offered his full-throated support to activists and organizers fighting for social justice. He also reaffirmed their choice to fight tyranny amid a \"gutting of democracies.\" \"As Christians and all people of good will, it is for us to live and act at this moment,\" he said, as reported by the Guardian. \"It is a grave responsibility, since certain present realities, unless effectively dealt with, are capable of setting off processes of dehumanization which would then be hard to reverse.\" The draft was read this week at the opening of the U.S. Regional World Meeting of Popular Movements in Modesto, Calif. The pope did not reference President Trump directly, but parts of his message seemed tailor-made for this particular moment. \"The direction taken beyond this historic turning point - the ways in which this worsening crisis gets resolved - will depend on people's involvement and participation and, largely, on yourselves, the popular movements,\" Francis said. He also condemned the growth of populist and xenophobic movements, calling them a \"grave danger for humanity.\" And he criticized leaders who rely on \"fear, insecurity, quarrels, and even people's justified indignation, in order to shift the responsibility for all these ills on to a 'non-neighbor.' \" None of these statements are particularly shocking. But what's notable is the frequency with which the pope is speaking out. Francis has become one of the world's staunchest defenders of immigrants, Muslims and liberal democracy itself.",

Free will comes with consequences. How the misery of eternal estrangement from God (i.e., Hell) has been taught has changed greatly over the ages and reflects the cultures in which it's been taught. But for a Christian not to teach his children that moral choices can be gravely consequential would be as much a dereliction of duty and a failure of love as letting a toddler put her hand on a hot stove.

            "body": "President Trump. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) President Trump had a moment of clarity during his wild press conference Thursday. Ever the poll-doubter, he actually acknowledged his polling reality. \"Some of the things I'm doing probably aren't popular, but they're necessary for security and for other reasons,\" Trump said. That right there suggests all of Trump's bluster about how every negative poll is \"fake news\" is just that - bluster. But it also reveals something else about Trump: He isn't terribly concerned about being unpopular. All he truly feels the need to do is keep his base happy. And he's doing just fine on that count. A new poll from the Pew Research Center shows Trump's GOP base, if anything, is slightly happier than many other recent presidents' bases have been. For all the talk about how Trump's approval ratings are the lowest for a new president in modern history and all of the increasingly public hand-wringing by elected Republicans, actual GOP voters are still very much onboard the Trump train. Fully 84 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents approve of Trump right now. Of the last six presidents, only Barack Obama was in better shape with his base the month after his inauguration, with 86 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaners. Both Bushes were at 82 percent, and Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan were slightly under 80 percent. Trump, of course, is doing considerably worse than his predecessors with everyone else. Hence the 39 percent approval rating in Pew's poll and the 40 percent approval rating in the Gallup tracking poll. His overall approval rating, as Gallup notes, is 21 points below the average dating back to Dwight Eisenhower. Update: New numbers just released by Gallup show the slide continues. Trump's numbers dropping to 38 percent approval and 56 percent disapproval. Source: Gallup But there's a credible case to be made that overall approval matters less than in the past. As I wrote last week, Republicans have majorities in both chambers of Congress, which means Trump doesn't really need a lot of crossover support. He may get some, simply because some Senate Democrats come from very pro-Trump states, but Trump is far less reliant on bipartisan support than a president who is dealing with split control of Congress: And a big reason is that the only party he really needs to appeal to - his own - is still onboard, as it has been for a while. Even in June, at the bottom of Candidate Trump's image ratings - 29 percent favorable vs. 70 percent unfavorable - he still had the support of 65 percent of Republicans. About 34 percent of Republicans had an unfavorable view of their soon-to-be nominee. Even in such a case, though, Trump could arguably still govern. Republicans, after all, have majorities in both chambers of Congress, and the vast majority of Republicans in Congress come from safe districts and states. As long as a majority of their primary electorates liked Trump, these members would feel pressure to support him. Trump now has much more unified GOP support than he did back in June - 84 percent vs. 65 percent. Sure it would be nice for Trump if everyone loved him, but that's not the same as saying he needs that love to actually accomplish what he wants to. And given he was elected president with his approval rating hovering right around where it is now, you can see why Trump may not feel the need to change it up. All of this could change, of course. We still haven't seen Congress start the difficult work of passing major legislation like health care and tax reform. And given the tight 52-48 Republican Senate majority, if even three GOP senators desert Trump on any given issue, he's got problems. But by doing so, they would be running afoul of a president whom an overwhelming majority of their party's base still likes. And after they were burned over and over again when they tried to stop Trump during the campaign, you can bet that shows of obstinacy will have to be considered carefully. From the very beginning, Trump's lackluster approval ratings have beguiled all of us. They're why we insisted he couldn't win the GOP primary or the presidency. And you can bet they've got plenty of people wagering that he'll never win reelection in 2020. But in our increasingly partisan country and with a GOP-controlled Congress, that overall number probably means less than we think it does.

So when Republican Congressmen continue to back Trump, the majority of Americans who despise him will reject the Republican Congressman in favor of some new outsider Democrat.

If Republicans in Congress begin to perceive that a close association with the Trump White House and his policies might be a liability to reelection, they will begin to distance themselves quickly.

            "body": "The search for the District's permanent police chief is entering its final stages, according to officials close to the mayor, with most if not all interviews complete and an announcement on Cathy L. Lanier's replacement expected soon. Little information has seeped out from the tight circle of advisers at the John A. Wilson building, led by Kevin Donahue, the deputy mayor for public safety. His group has narrowed a field of more than 100 applicants down to, at most, a few dozen identified as the most experienced and qualified to run one of the nation's highest-profile police departments. The leading contender remains Peter J. Newsham, who has been an assistant chief for 14 of his 27 years on the force and was tapped in August by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) to serve as interim chief until a permanent replacement is named. Lanier left in September to take over security for the National Football League. Newsham, who declined to comment on the search, has made no secret that he wants the top job, and he has not let his interim status stop him from implementing change or speaking out. He is ever-present at community crime walks and has made himself available to the media. He forged a deal to end a long-running dispute with the union over overtime pay and joined other chiefs opposing President Trump's demands that local police help federal authorities seek out undocumented immigrants. [Cathy L. Lanier leaves top D.C. police post work for NFL] Officials with knowledge of the search process said the finalists are either current or former D.C. officers. Bowser did not launch a formal national search, preferring to hire from inside the department, though she entertained applicants from outside the force if they showed interest. Names of applicants have not been divulged. Identities of some possible candidates have surfaced - among them assistant chiefs Robert J. Contee III and Diane Groomes. But giving Newsham the interim job for the past five months also provided him with a public platform not available to other candidates. One of Bowser's aides, who spoke on the condition of not being named because of the secretive selection process, said the mayor \"has been pleased with the job that Chief Newsham has done in his interim position. He is certainly someone who is getting a very serious look at having the position permanently. That is a testament to how well the mayor thinks he has performed.\" D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said Bowser has not provided him any names. He called the long process for choosing Lanier's successor \"a mistake\" and said Newsham should have been named permanent chief by now. \"Unless there is unhappiness in the acting incumbent, or there is a need for outside change, there's no reason to risk undermining confidence within the department,\" Mendelson said. \"People should feel like there's a promotional track. . . .I don't know if it's horrible that they're dotting the i's and crossing the t's, but it's been four or five months and I think Peter Newsham is a good candidate.\" Officials in the mayor's office had said they wanted to wait to decide on the police chief's job until after a school chancellor had been chosen, and to get through President Trump's inauguration. In his time as interim chief, Newsham led security during the presidential inauguration, and protests, some of which turned violent. He also has headed the department through several police-involved shootings, including one of a motorcyclist who was unarmed. That shooting remains under grand jury review. Contee, an assistant chief well liked by many District residents and who was pushed as a favorite by a vice president of the labor union representing D.C. officers, declined to comment. He heads human resources, which includes the academy's recruiting division, the night life unit and disciplinary review. Other possible candidates could not be reached. The police union remains neutral. Lanier had been regarded as one of the most popular chiefs in the country. Though homicides spiked in 2015, overall violent crime dropped during her tenure and the number of people killed on District streets hit lows not seen in decades. Under Lanier, the District had broken free of its \"Murder Capital of America\" namesake from the late 1980s and early '90s when crack cocaine flooded the streets and annual murders soared into the upper 400s. Also, the District has escaped the shouts for wholesale police reform and angry protests over killings by police seen in cities such as New York, Baltimore, Ferguson, Mo., Charlotte and Milwaukee. It's also not had the seemingly out-of-control violence hitting Chicago. [Search to replace Lanier begins] Bowser's chief spokesman, Kevin Harris, said the city's chief executive understands that \"not every major city has fared as well as the District . . . and her focus is ensuring we continue to do the things necessary that keep us moving in the right direction.\" He said Bowser wants an \"experienced candidate who believes in the power of working hand in hand with communities to fight crime\" and \"who can command both the respect of the community and rank-and-file police.\" [Challenges ahead for next police chief] D.C. Council Member Charles Allen (D Ward-6), chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety, said he has purposely asked to not be briefed on candidate names because he will chair the panel leading the confirmation hearing. But Allen said he would prefer a chief from inside the department who, like Lanier, worked her way up to the top post and managed to work under three mayors. \"I think the biggest priority has to be the relationship of policing to the community,\" Allen said. But even more pressing, according to the council member, is bolstering a force that has lost members in the past few years, dropping from nearly 4,000 to roughly 3,750 officers, even as the city continues to grow. \"I think we have tremendous officers, but we also have to find ways to recruit, and retain the people and talent we have,\" Allen said. One of his colleagues on the council, former mayor Vincent C. Gray (D-Ward 7) is proposing raises and retention bonuses. Allen is pitching a housing incentives to help officers. \"Whoever the next permanent police chief is will have to focus on stabilizing our police force in terms of numbers,\" Allen said.",

            "body": "Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos is locked in a van that is stopped by protesters outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Feb. 8, in Phoenix. (Rob Schumacher/Arizona Republic via AP) There are any number of hard-to-understand components to the draft memo that reportedly circulated in the White House, mobilizing 100,000 National Guard members to act as a deportation force for immigrants in the country illegally in 11 southwestern states. But one issue is that the proposal - which the White House says isn't on the table - targets states that are home to less than half of the estimated undocumented immigrant population. Pew Research tracks data on that population. People often wonder how accurate numbers can be compiled on a group that almost by definition seeks to avoid notice - but there's a simple answer. As a Pew demographer explained to me last year, nearly all of those born in Mexico now live in either Mexico or the United States. Figure out the population living in Mexico, the population living legally in the United States and compare that to birth records by year. The difference? Those living in the United States illegally. That total, incidentally, has stayed flat over the past several years of Pew analysis. In fact, for several years after the recession, net migration between the United States and Mexico sent more people south than north. That draft executive order would have deployed National Guard members through 11 states: The four directly adjoining Mexico and the seven states that connect them to the rest of the continental United States. The effect of sending deputized Guardsmen through the Southwest to deport immigrants raises the specter of an Eisenhower-era effort that Trump once praised: \"Operation Wetback.\" That effort sent Border Patrol agents first into California and then into Texas to pick out and deport immigrants in the country illegally. Trump never used the name of the operation, for perhaps obvious reasons, but he endorsed the idea and the outcome. It's worth noting, though, that the density of the population of immigrants in the country illegally doesn't mirror the focus of that memo. According to Pew's analysis of data (the most recent of which is from 2014), slightly less than half of the 11 million or so undocumented immigrants - 5.3 million - live in those 11 states. Only about 900,000 live in the seven states that don't touch the border. By contrast, 5.9 million live everywhere else. The reason for this? As Pew discovered when it analyzed data recently, about 60 percent of immigrants without documentation are living in 20 large urban areas. Certainly there is a large population of immigrants in, for example, California's Central Valley, working in agriculture. But there are far more living in Los Angeles. This makes sense: More people live in cities, where ... more people live. As a percentage of the overall population in the Central Valley, the density of undocumented immigrants is higher. But it's not where most undocumented immigrants live. This necessarily shifts how we look at that draft memo. The memo's proposal is tied to geography in a way that doesn't match the distribution of immigrants who live in the country illegally. This may help explain why the administration doesn't plan to put the proposal into place. It may also help explain why, in the weeks since the Jan. 25 date on that memo, the focus of immigration raids has been on sweeps that are less geographically focused. It's not National Guardsmen sweeping through Visalia, Calif.; it's Immigrations and Customs Enforcement arresting immigrants in cities. In other words, instead of a heavy-handed focus in the Southwest, the administration may have decided on a more deliberate touch everywhere in the country.",

            "body": "A car travels along Kingsbury Lane in Kennebunk, Maine, on Feb. 16. An overnight winter storm unleashed more than a foot of wet, heavy snow on parts of Maine and New Hampshire by Thursday, closing schools, knocking out power and pushing snow tallies to levels unseen in years. (Gregory Rec/Portland Press Herald via AP) While large portions of the Lower 48 are witnessing a year without a winter, Maine is one of just a couple regions that is a notable exception. A trio of powerful winter storms pummeled communities from Maine to the Canadian Maritime provinces over the past week, leaving a blanket of snow up to 8 feet deep in some locations. The 1-2-3 punch of storms knocked out power, closed schools and businesses, caused numerous accidents and has generally crippled the region. \"Snow depths across Maine are near record territory this morning!,\" the National Weather Service office serving the region around Portland reported Thursday. Great MODIS satellite shot from this morning showing the extensive snow cover across New England. #mewx pic.twitter.com/lBOJKu5Fbs - NWS Caribou (@NWSCaribou) February 17, 2017 The town of Andover had a mind-boggling settled snow pack of 79 inches, or just over 6.5 feet. That now stands as the second deepest snow pack ever measured in Maine for a non-mountainous reporting station. Chimney Pond at an elevation of 2,900 feet, is stacked under 94 inches of the white stuff. The Weather Service tweeted that Maine had received more snow than anywhere else in the Lower 48 away from the western mountains and northern Great Lakes. \"Trees and limbs are breaking under the weight of the snow. The wires that we've seen taken down tonight have been quickly buried in the snow making them almost impossible to see,\" the Waterboro Fire Department posted on Facebook. \"If your power is out, make sure your wires are still up before venturing out to clean up this lovely mess.\" Another major concern is roofs collapsing under the stress of the snow. Citizens are being advised to clear snow from their roofs or hire someone to do it. All three storms explosively intensified or \"bombed out\" as they moved over the Gulf of Maine and interacted with parts of the Gulf Stream. Storms that \"bomb out\" or undergo \"bombogenesis\" see their central pressure drop at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. The lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. #Bombogenesis 3 times in a week in the same area pic.twitter.com/2JN2mON2ey - Stu Ostro (@StuOstro) February 17, 2017 The bombing storms hammered coastal areas with winds in excess of 70 mph and pumped massive amounts of moisture inland that fell mostly as snow. Other notable Maine snow depths are 68 inches in Kingfield, 62 inches in Hartford, 31 inches in Bangor and 31 inches in Caribou. Current Snow Depth in Maine= Epic. pic.twitter.com/JBEmqtqZ2k - Keith Carson (@KeithCarson) February 16, 2017 The Sugarloaf Mountain ski area reported 51 inches of snow, which it tweeted is the deepest powder in more than 20 years. The Canadian Maritime provinces were also hammered by the snow blitz. As of Thursday Halifax, Nova Scotia, had broken its record for snowiest February ever with 54.5 inches. The previous record, set in 2015, was 51.5 inches. That took the entire month, the new record was set in the first 16 days. In the wake of snowy onslaught, there is finally light at the end of the tunnel. A warm-up is in the forecast with sunny skies and highs expected to reach the low 40s by this weekend. But with so much snow on the ground, emergency managers will need to keep an eye on river levels as a rapid warm-up could create flooding. Here are some photos of the epic snow amounts ...

            "body": "Top view of laptop in girl's hands sitting on wooden floor with coffee (iStock) We all know that the technology industry has a gender problem. But how do you move the needle from awareness to action? Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, and Girls Who Code, a nonprofit tech group, have an idea: take the fight to the states. On Friday, both will host the first-ever Girls Who Code Governor's Summit at Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. The guest list includes Govs. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma and Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa. Many organizations aimed at improving gender equality in the tech field have focused on changing the culture at tech companies in the past. But this is the first time an effort is aimed at the state level. \"\u200bWhat's great about having these governors and state officials involved is that they set the educational agenda for their states,\" Sandberg said. And, she said, reaching young kids - as Girls Who Code has done on a smaller scale - is key to improving tech's gender problems long-term. [Pay Up is a community for women who want to support each other and get closer to closing the gender gap. Join here.] Fallin, Raimondo and Reynolds all spearhead programs in their states to increase access to computer science education -  through programs expanding broadband access or even directing all schools to include some computer science education. The point of the summit, in part, is to compare notes and come up with standards and organized ways of measuring efforts that aim to support girls and women who are interested in tech and science. \"We can't afford to have half of America's brain power not engaging,\" said Raimondo, who has directed all Rhode Island schools to teach computer science classes by December 2017. The conversation comes at a time when - despite a lot of discussion about the problem - the gender gap in tech is getting worse. In 1984, 37 percent of all computer science graduates were women. Today, that number is 18 percent, according to a survey done by Accenture and Girls Who Code last year. Data from the Census Bureau show a similar decline in the workplace. Reshma Saujani, the founder of Girls Who Code, said she found that number chilling. \"We've had our heads down for the past six years. How is this getting worse?\" Girls Who Code, which launched in 2012, has since put at least 10,000 young girls through the program - only some of whom have since entered college, and are majoring in computer science. Saujani said she saw that study as a rallying cry, to step up her efforts and use states' growing interest in computer science to collect good data and get to the heart of what may be contributing to that decline. \"\u200bWhat's the gender makeup of those classrooms? We know anecdotally it's normally 70 percent boys and 30 percent girls,\" she said. Working with states, she said, lets her group and others \"very closely watch the diversity and gender numbers\" in schools and find out what is going on. One reason behind the gap could be what Saujani calls the high school trap in which girls may not see their peers or role models interested in science, or told that it's a \"boy\" thing. Others looking at the problem think we're not starting early enough. \"We need to be thinking long-term and making long-term investments,\" said Raimondo. \"That's why we're teaching computer science in kindergarten.\" Another reason could be that making such a change on a bigger scale takes time. Many of today's most visible programs launched to get girls interested in coding have started within the past decade. \"Think of Title IX, for example: look at how long it took to work its way into the system,\" said Jessica Rovello, chief executive of Arkadium - a technology publishing company that boasts an executive staff of more than 50 percent women. \"To go all those years and then, in this last Olympics, have all these women start winning gold medals. That's how the dots were connected there.\" Rovello is not involved in the summit, but has worked on different initiatives to get more women into technology jobs. Besides getting more girls interested in tech, she thinks that there should be cultural changes at companies. \"Initiatives can fill out the pipeline. Once you have them in the business, though, you have to figure out: how do you keep them in the business?\" she said. At Arkadium, she's taken steps to ensure, for example, that all her employees are trained to acknowledge their own biases and feel comfortable communicating. And, she said, companies must continue seeking out qualified female candidates. \"I think that qualified women and minorities are there if you care to look and find them,\" she said. (Arkadium works on The Washington Post's games section.) At the other end of the pipeline, Saujani said she thinks that it's possible to close the tech gender gap in a decade - if advocates can direct the energy, focus on gathering good data and setting metrics, and follow through on their goals. The summit attendees already have plans to reconvene in six months at the National Governors Association, to compare notes and recruit more states to their cause. \"We have the wind at our back,\" Saujani said. \"We have their attention - policy is being sought out right now about how to get to every child interested in computer science. We need to be addressing some of the barriers that are keeping girls out of field at the same time.\"",

            "body": "Supporters of immigrant rights march in the District on Feb. 16. (Jose Luis Magana/AP) Immigrant communities around the nation's capital and across the country are reeling in the wake of what appears to be the first wave of detentions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement since the inauguration of President Trump. The federal government said the series of raids last week that led to the arrests of at least 683 \"criminal aliens\" targeted undocumented immigrants who face criminal charges and did not represent a major change from Obama administration policies. But immigrants, their advocates and lawyers say that many people without criminal records also were taken, spreading fear in cities and counties that are home to many foreign-born people. Here are some of their stories: Highlandtown, Baltimore Sebardo Fernandez Rodriguez and Manuel Lopez Suarez were arrested Feb. 8 in what CASA de Maryland staff lawyer Lila Zazula called an \"open-air raid\" outside a Walgreens in Baltimore's Highlandtown neighborhood. Neither men, according to CASA, has a criminal record or even a traffic ticket. The location where they were arrested, just off Eastern Avenue, was the site of other immigration enforcement actions during the early part of President Barack Obama's tenure. Lopez Suarez was double-parked in a rental car about three blocks from the Walgreens, waiting to give someone a ride, said Zazula, who interviewed him and Fernandez Rodriguez for several hours. ICE agents came to his window asking for his license and registration and whether he had a green card, to which Lopez Suarez replied no. They took him into custody. Lopez Suarez comes from Ecuador and first arrived in this country as a 15-year-old. He was detained at the border until a family member, an uncle from Chicago, claimed him, Zazula said. Three years later, a judge issued a deportation order for Lopez. Meanwhile, he moved to Baltimore, married and had two U.S.-born children, now 10 and 12 years old. He is a business owner, restoring old homes in Baltimore and doing home improvement work. Fernandez Rodriguez is originally from Honduras and is a barber. He has been in Baltimore for a little more than a year, according to a friend, and has become well known in the community as a passionate cyclist and local volunteer. He left his country after gang members threatened his life and tried to extort money from his barbershop, Zazula said. Once in this country, Zazula said, Fernandez Rodriguez should have undergone a \"credible fear\" interview. Instead he signed a voluntary deportation order - he told Zazula he did not know what it was. He was sent back to Honduras but returned to the United States, in violation of the order. Zazula said Fernandez Rodriguez went to the Walgreens the night of Feb. 8 with his girlfriend to buy some makeup-removing wipes. He walked to his car in the parking lot and got inside, then lights appeared in his rear window. The officers asked Fernandez Rodriguez and his girlfriend for their driver's licenses, Zazula said. Then the officers asked Fernandez Rodriguez whether he had a green card. When he said no, they arrested and fingerprinted him. His girlfriend was not arrested, though she is also undocumented and has a pending deportation order. A flier is posted on the door of a Mexican restaurant closed in support of immigrant rights on Feb. 16 in the District. (Jose Luis Magana/AP) Centreville Maria Barraza, a parent liaison at London Towne Elementary School in Centreville, Va., said that the mother of a Head Start student last week came to school distraught at pickup time. Sobbing, she told school officials that her son's father had been detained by immigration officials hours earlier. The man had dropped off their child in the morning at the school. As he was walking home, he was stopped by ICE agents, questioned and taken into custody, Barraza said. She declined to provide the name of the child or his parents, referring inquiries to the Fairfax County school system's public information office. A spokesman for the school system said officials there were unaware of the incident. Route 1 corridor, Fairfax County Oscar Ramirez and Thermon Brewster, two men who sleep at the Rising Hope United Methodist Mission Church's hypothermia shelter in Alexandria, Va., said ICE agents detained seven immigrants the morning of Feb. 8 just as they left the shelter, which closes for the daytime hours at 7 a.m. The pair said about a dozen agents surrounded them and other men after they had walked across the street from the church to a shopping center. They did not draw any weapons but ordered some of the men to stand against the wall of the Aldi grocery store and questioned them one at a time about their legal status. \"It's awful strange that guys can walk out a church and be detained like that,\" Brewster said in an interview. \"I think that's wrong.\" The agents scanned the men's thumbs on-site using a device that brought up any criminal records. Ramirez said a few men, including him, had misdemeanors such as disorderly conduct, missing court dates and public drunkenness. Ramirez was one of the men detained, but he has a green card and was released. There were other, less detailed reports of additional raids along the Route 1 corridor, which has a large immigrant population. Ramirez and Brewster said most of those who were taken outside the Aldi were loaded in one van that arrived at the site with several detainees on board. There were shackles on their feet and around their hands. A second van also showed up to the site. \"They come here to lay their heads,\" Ramirez said of the men who were apprehended after spending the night in the church-run shelter. \"It's not right to mess with people like that.\" Lawyers from the Northern Virginia chapter of the Legal Aid Justice Center lead a \"Know Your Rights\" class in Annandale, Va., on Feb. 16 (Arelis R. Hernandez/The Washington Post) 'Know Your Rights' seminar The small county government meeting room in Annandale filled quickly Thursday night. About 100 people sat and stood shoulder to shoulder to learn more about the immigration enforcement actions this month that have triggered panic in their Northern Virginia communities. The \"Know Your Rights\" session was organized by the Legal Aid Justice Center, a group of pro bono lawyers, to help people avoid detention in the future. \"Repeat after me,\" said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, legal director for the center's immigrant advocacy program. \"Tengo el derecho de guardar silencio,\" he started in Spanish. \"I have the right to remain silent.\" The crowd pronounced the words slowly, somberly and in unison. \"I want to talk to my lawyer,\" they continued. And if there is a knock on the door, lawyers warned, \"don't open the door.\" Sandoval-Moshenberg quickly ran through several suggestions: Identify a trusted friend to oversee things in case you get arrested. Put all important documents in a safe, accessible place. Create an emergency plan. \"If you're detained, who is going to take care of your children?\" Sandoval-Moshenberg asked the men and women gathered. Their eyes opened wide with concern. Many parents had brought their children to the meeting. The youngsters crawled under chairs, shrieking as they chased one another between the legs of the adults. One by one, the attendees sat down with legal-aid volunteers who helped them fill out power-of-attorney documents and prepare. The families and individuals all brought their own set of particulars. \"She was born here,\" one man said, turning his eyes to the round-faced toddler on his lap drinking vigorously from a baby bottle. \"I own a house,\" another said to the volunteer sitting across the table. \"What should I do?\" \"What document do I fill out to protect my children? They all have papers.\" Maria Romero sat alone in a corner of the room, rolling a dozen or so documents in her hand and staring out vacuously. She arrived in the United States five months ago from Honduras, fleeing violence with her 14-year-old son. Now, he is watching news of ICE raids on Spanish-language television and barely eating. Mexican law enforcement let them through as they traveled north, she recalled, saying \"Go, and never look back,\" Romero recalled. She turned herself in to Border Patrol agents after entering the United States, went to her hearings and was given a court date for 2019. \"I believe getting here was my destiny,\" Romero said between tears. \"But I never imagined the affliction I would encounter here. We can't go back.\"",

All along having health problems (paying cash for care, thank you very much), and other bills unable to produce all that money just to get the piece of paper? In the meantime he's paid his share of taxes for decades, and even forewent his social security all because he can't produce the document.

It's insulting to those who came here legally and followed the rules, and it's one of the reasons why crime is so bad and cost of living is off set.  \n\nGo after companies hiring illegals, go after companies providing funds to them, stop the free handouts, and give them the boot.  I am glad they listed the restaurants that took part in a day without immigrants. I no longer eat at those establishments.  Let their staff eat there...enough already.

Then, some of those diseases, such as TB, are transmitted to the general population through their work at restaurants which underpay them and schedule them to duck the local health inspections.\n\nBottom line is that the illegals and we, the legals and taxpayers, get used by the employers who want cheap labor and pols who see them as a future voting bloc.\n\n\nIt's time to start arresting the employers of  illegal labor and start imprisoning them and fining them heavily.
